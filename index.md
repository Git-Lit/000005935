f" "t 0 presumptive a step as the publication of a
{empty}A.®J new History of Kent when the ground has

already been exploited by masterly hands demands an
explanation.


Until within quite recent years the orthodox County
History consisted of a detailed account of the various
parishes, abounding with such details as pedigrees,
monumental epitaphs, biographies of local celebrities and others,
and various statistics of very little interest to the general
reader. In the following pages I have endeavoured to
paint the picture of by-gone Kent with a larger and a
fuller brush, and I have carefully avoided all details which,
however valuable per se, and however interesting to a few

readers, do not appeal very strongly to the lover of Kent
who is desirous of getting some idea of Kent's place in
our national history—perhaps a more distinguished place
than is occupied by any other county.


To many sins of omission I may, therefore, in the eyes
of some people have to plead guilty. Such sins of
commission as may be exposed will not at any rate have been
caused by any want of thoroughness in my attempts to
get at the truth, for I have personally visited almost every
place in the county in the smallest degree associated with
its history.


The illustrations are from my own sketches made upon
the spots represented, with four exceptions—the views of
Cobham Hall and of the roof of Eltham Palace, which are
copied from engravings, and the portraits of Alfred Mynn
and Fuller Pilch, which are copied from lithographs at the
Gate Inn, Leeds Castle.


The Map of Kent is the result of a careful examination
of the opinions of acknowledged authorities on the subject,
and of a personal investigation of the countiy. The Map
of the Armada Beacons is copied, with a few alterations,
from a Map in the British Museum, re-produced for the
information of the AVar Office at the time of the Invasion
scares at the beginning of the present century.

  HISTORY OF KENT.  
  
  
  I.-EARLY KENT.

\ I /HE first real knowledge we get of our county is
& I (s) from the pen of Julius Cæsar. Previous to him
it is quite impossible to distinguish myth from

history, and we may at once dismiss, as unworthy of
serious consideration, the man}7 fables associated with
the so-called earliest mentions of Kent. Certain
established facts, however, cannot be overlooked— that for
several centuries before the Christian era there was
a commercial relationship between Britain and the
civilized nations of the South, and that for probably
a considerable time before Cæsar's invasion in B.C. 55
there had been established a large trade in slaves and
grain between Kent and Roman Gaul. That the island
of Thanet may be identified with the great tin shipping
port of Mictis or Ictis we cannot believe, if only
because it prompts the question: AA"hy should the
Phenicians trouble to carry the tin they got in Cornwall
along three hundred miles of coast to Thanet because of
the short sea passage thence to Gaul when their ships
were stout enough to traverse the seas of all the then
known world ?


AVithout, therefore, wasting time and space upon
conjectures and guesses about matters the real truth of
which can never be established, let us at once deal with  
  
  
  B
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 2 -->
certainties, and endeavour to picture the County of Kent
as from various incontrovertible evidence it seems to have
been presented to the eyes of its first invaders.


The three chief features of physical change in Kent
during the nineteen centuries and a half which have
elapsed since Julius Cæsar made his first pi'ospecting
expedition are :  
  
  
  1.—In the face of the county generally.  
  
  
  2.—In the configuration of its North East Corner.  
  
  
  3.—In the aspect of its South East Marsh Land.

(I)—The General Aspect of Kent.


There is abundant evidence to show that Kent at the
period of the first Roman expedition was essentially7 a
wooded county, broken only by lines of open down such as
that which stretches in a semi-circle from Dover to
Chartham, by the valleys of the greater livers, and by the
tracks of marshland. One third of the county was
genuine forest—trackless, uninhabited, dense forest, the
haunt of many animals and birds which have long since
disappeared from our national fauna. This was a portion
of the great Sylva Anderida which extended over and
be}rond the neighbouring County of Sussex, and wliich
was known as the AVeald. Roughly speaking the
Northern Kentish limit of this forest is marked by the
line of the South-Eastern Railway from AA'estenhanger to
Sevenoaks, although the valley of the Medway cuts
deeply tlirough it at one point, whilst on the other hand
between Tonbridge and Sevenoaks the forest makes a bold
Northerly trend. Place names are a pretty sure guide in
our delimitation of the natural AA*ealden boundary, which,
we need not remark, is a very different affair from the
political or social AA'ealden boundary, and when we get
away from the "hursts" and "dens " and " charts" and
\"hatches," we get away from the AA'eald.


Between this Northern AA'ealden Boundary—or, for the
sake of clearness, let us adopt the artificial line of the
South-Eastern Railway, and another artificial line, the
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 3 -->
Roman Watling Street, the country consisted almost
entirely, as it does to this day, of woodland, sufficiently
scattered and thin to allow of the residence of a large
population, and of the course of roads and trackways.


North of the AAratling Street from where Sandwich now
stands as far as AA'oolwich, was marshland, broken AA'est
and North of Canterbury by the Forest of the Blean, and
all along its western course by innumerable inlets and
arms of sea and river.  
  
  
  (II)—The Change in the North East Corner of  
  
  
  Kent.


This is highly interesting, and although to some degree
conjecture must enter into a modern consideration of this
change, and opinions are necessarily divided as to details,
certain main facts seem to have become established.


Thanet was an island in the real sense, inasmuch as
between it and the mainland stretched mud-flats covered
at high tide by water through the midst of which wound
the " river" AA'antsum. In 597, says Bede, the River
AVantsum was about three furlongs wide, so that we may
estimate the space between Thanet and the mainland to
have been at the widest points about a couple of miles,
although between the site of Regulbium and where Brook
End marks the end of a deep inlet the distance is nearer
four miles.


This Estuary was a much used line of communication
between London and the Channel, and so existed until
about the year 14G0, and perhaps from this trade
connection with London, the ancient name of Stonar—
Lundenwic may be traced.


The land on which the few houses constituting Stonar
stand was in Roman times a narrow spit of beach
comingstraight down to opposite Sandwich from Cliffsend on the
one side and Ebbsfleet on the other. Beach stones have
been found at more than one place along this stretch of
land twelve feet below the surface. That the AVantsum
river ran. to a considerable depth owing to the  
  
  
  e8
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 4 -->
contributions it received from the " fleets " on either side,
would seem to be proved by the fact that during its entire
length of eight miles there were but two fords, at Sarre
and at Sandwich.


After the year 1460 the process of obstruction, which
had at a much earlier date gained for the river its name
(so say some etymologists) became very marked, although
fifty years later there were men living who remembered
having seen laden barges pass along it, and even in 1590
one John Twine says that there were eight men living who
had seen large ships go through. Leland says that in the
time of Henry VIII. salt water ran in at the North
mouth more than a mile towards Sarre.


Stourmouth, now four miles inland, marks where the
Great and Little Stour rivers united to flow into the
estuary7, the Stour being navigable as far as Fordwich,
which was the port of Canterbury, down to the days of
Elizabeth, and, as a " limb " of Sandwich, enjoyed Cinque
Port privileges. Fordwich was until comparatively7
recently7, a corporate town, but when the north mouth of
the estuary began to be blocked, and Sandwich Haven
became silted up, it lost its importance.


At Sarre there had been a ford at a very early date, and
so late as 1485 it could be used for an hour at very high
spring tides.


Ebbsfleet was a port in the 12th century, but in Roman
times it was probably what its name signifies, a tidal
channel. Minster was a busy port in the 13th century,
Minster Fleet being its haven. The imposing ruin of
Richborough stands upon what was evidently an island,
and the fortress commanded the Southern entrance of the
AVantsum Estuary, just as Regulbium commanded the
Northern. Indeed one may trace to-day almost exactly
the dimensions of Richborough island despite the fact
that the land stood higher—or rather that the level of the
water was very much lower—than the level of the Marsh
wliich now represents it.  
  
  
  AVhether Ebbsfleet or Stonar is to be distinguished as
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 5 -->
the landing place of the first Jutes and of Augustine, is
still a much disputed point. At any rate Stonar was for
centuries an important town and port. That the Romans
occupied it is evident from the remains which have been
from time to time discovered; possibly it was the second
Rutupia, thus accounting for the plural form of the Latin
name of Richborough. It was for some time a rival of
Sandwich, and until the French burned it in 1385 was a
chief port of this part of Kent.


It has yet to be settled at what exact point the fortress
of Richborough was connected with the two roads coming
from Canterbury and from Dover which should seemingly
unite at Each End, although the latter stops short at
AYoodnesborough. This point must have been an
important place, and interesting results might reward
examination.


To trace the coast of the mainland at the time of
Cæsar's first invasion we may follow this route; from
Sandwich by the Polders to Each End, by Brook Street to
Cooper Street, thence to the farmhouse which marks
where may have been the port of Fleet, then by Goldstone
and AA*est Marsh to Lower Stourmouth. Thence to Upper
Stourmouth, across the Little Stour to Grove, across the
Great Stour at Grove Ferry to Up Street, AA'all End, and
by Chislet—the " beach eyot " to the site of Regulbium.


It can hardly be described as an encursion brimming
with rollicking excitement, for the Marsh World is very
dead, the poor villages contain very few objects of
interest, and the scenery is unlovely7. But it gives a far
clearer idea of the ancient geographical " lie" of the
country than any map or descriptive letter press, and the
line between upland and marsh is still so clearly defined,
that here perhaps more completely than in other places
over which waves of change have passed we can fill in the
picture of the Past.  
  
  
  (Ill)—The Aspect of the South Eastern Marsh  
  
  
  Land.


The changes wrought here have a different sort of
interest from those just treated of, inasmuch as they have
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 6 -->
been to a great extent the work of man. AA*hen Cæsar
first arrived in Kent the great marshes of Romney,
Denge, Guldeford, and Walling formed a tidal morass, a
vast mud-flat alternately covered and uncovered as the
tide rose and fell, and, probably at no remotely previous
period had been a regular bay of the sea.


The River Limen or Rother, coming from Sussex
tlirough Newenden, flowed to Appledore where it ran into
an estuary of the sea which followed the base of the cliffs
pretty closely along the line of the modern Military Canal,
to Lympne where, no doubt, -was a bay of the sea.

It was perhaps during the Roman occupation that
accumulations of shingle at Hythe and Lympne began so
much to reduce the volume of tidal water to Appledore,
that the idea became feasible of partially shutting it off.
AVe say partially, instead of entirely7, because it is evident
that unless the operation was carried out at a very much
later date than is generally supposed, there was water
communication between Lympne and Appledore in the
year 893, when the Danes sailed from the former port to
burn the latter.


This was carried into effect by the construction of that
great engineering work, the Rhee AA'all. This was a
channel of from eighty to a hundred feet in width, with
high banks, cut from Appledore to where New
Romney now is, into which the waters of the Rother were
turned at Appledore, and forming at Romney a safe and
capacious harbour.


By the making of this Rhee AA'all, along the course of
which the present high road from Appledore to Romney
runs almost exactly, the whole of what we call Romney
Marsh proper became capable of reclamation and
cultivation, as with the Rhee Wall on the South AA*est and the
encroaching shingle bank on the South East it was
protected from the sea. It is probably just to credit the
Romans witli this fine work by which 24,000 acres of land
were made available for human use, as the whole area of
Romney7 Marsh proper is scattered with remains of a
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 7 -->
character not met with in the other Marshes. At any
rate it seems to be established that Romney Marsh was
utilised aud inhabited long before the other Marshes
were even reclaimed. Not until late in the thirteenth
century was AA'alland Marsh reclaimed, and by lhat time
Nature had wrought great changes in Romney Marsh.


Between 1236 and 1287 a series of violent storms swept
away the towns of Oswardestone, Dengemarsh, Old
AVinchelsea and Broomhill, and Dungeness was formed, Lydd
thereby being saved.


These inundations threatened Appledore, forced the
river Rother from its old bed at Appledore, and opened a
new course for it which made Rye its outlet, and took the
water from the Rhee Wall. In vain the Romney men
struggled gallantly against the fate which threatened their
town. A new channel was cut, and all through the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries cutting, and digging,
and devising went on, but Leland, writing in the reign of
Henry VIII., can only speak of Romney Haven as
something which " hath been," and records that the sea was two
miles away.


It is a question if Old Romney ever had a separate
existence, much less an importance of its own at all. At
any rate that which we call New Romney was a famous
place before the Conquest and so remained for more than
two hundred years after. As a distinctive name New
Romney is never used in documents before the fifteenth
century, Romney alone being spoken of, so that perhaps
the view of Mr. Furley, an acknowledged authority on the
AVeald and the Marshes, that Old and New Romney merely
represent two communities South and North of the Rhee
AVall is plausible. Dymchurch Wall as we know it is of
comparatively modern origin. It was not until the reign
of Henry VIII. that by the rapid accumulation of shingle
at Dungeness the safety of the lands lying behind the line
of the present wall was threatened, and even down to 1825
the only means of protection was a system of brushwood
piles. From that year dates the modern stone wall, and
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 8 -->
it is only by the most constant watching and at a heavy
expense that even this barrier is kept effective.


In conclusion of this very interesting portion of our
brief survey7 of Old Kent it may be noted that up to the
present day the wide region generally known as Romney
Marsh has retained a character and even a dialect of its
own; and until Lydd became an important military centre,
and golf gave a new lease of life to Romney, it remained
a terra incognita to the majority even of Kentish people.


The phrase in old documents " according to the laws and
customs of Romney Marsh " points to a separate political
and judicial existence; as does the record that when in
796 Cenulph King of Mercia invaded Kent, he laid it
waste, and cdso the province which is called Merscwari;
and Kemble suggests that the Merscware or Marshmen had
a kingdom or duchy of their own.


At any rate, until well within the memory of living men
the true Marshman rarely intermarried with or owned any
community of interests with folk " from the shires" or
"from beyond the hills;" he was born and married, he
lived and died amongst his own; he had his own dialect,
his own customs and traditional observances, and neither
knew nor cared much about what went on in the world
beyond his own limits except so far as it affected the
mutton and wool markets.  
  
  
  A few general changes may be noted


The Channel at the Straits of Dover was probably very
much shallower in Cæsar's time than it is now, and the
encroachments of thc sea on the North East Coast and at
the South AA'est corner of Romney Marsh, at the Isle of
Sheppey and along the Ramsgate and Reculver Coast are
still going on. Broomhill, which suffered in the great
storms of the thirteenth century is said by Harris to have
had fifty inns and taverns, and the ruins of its church Mere
visible in the middle of the 17th century.


The River Stour down to the reign of Elizabeth was a
navigable river of some size; there was traffic on it as far
inland as Chilham, at which there was a "port".—whieh
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 9 -->
may mean a market as well as a place of call for vessels,
and when Fordwich was the port of Canterbury, the Stour
must, of course, have been very much wider and deeper
than it is now.


Kent is especially7 rich in human remains of the
Paleolithic Age; and in specimens of human workmanship, but
not of human beings belonging to the Neolithic and the
Celtic or Bronze Age.
<!-- Leaf 24 -->
  
  II.—ROMAN KENT.

IT should be premised that almost all the history of Roman

Kent is based upon conjecture—scientific conjecture it

is true; the conjecture of men who have devoted and

are devoting their efforts to the dispersal or brightening of
the cloud which hangs over a period separated from that
which we are enabled at any rate to get a glimpse of by
the light of documentary and monumental evidence, by
absolute night; of men who, though following a profession
notorious for its proneness to jump at conclusions and to
work upon flimsy hypotheses, assert nothing and guess at
very little; of men, best fitted in fact by nature and
attainments to succeed as far as possible; but still
conjecture.


A singular poverty of monumental inscriptions in Kent
prevents the would be historian from arriving at such
exactitude as marks the conclusions of antiquaries in the
world let us say of Hadrian's AA'all. Not a dozen inscribed
altars have been discovered in the whole of Kent : in
Northumberland and Cumberland hardly a month passes
without some such discovery being made, and through the
medium of such discoveries antiquaries have been enabled
to put piece and piece of evidence together, and to arrive
at tolerably exact conclusions of which the result is history.
Moreover Kent being the earliest county to be
civilised, that is to say washed over and over again by
waves of change, being for a long time the most populous
part of our island, has naturally7 suffered most from the
<!-- Leaf 26 -->

  DURING THE ROMAN OCCUPATION

<!-- Leaf 27 -->

<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P27_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 11 -->
obliteration both by destruction and by burial, of such
monuments and records as would be of the most value in
the compilation of a rational history.


In short the Kentish antiquary is handicapped to an
extent with which his Northern brother is entirely
unfamiliar. Hence the uncertainty with which every assertion
about the history of Roman Kent must be made. One
instance will suffice. There were three Roman towns of
importance in Kent—in that small tract of country which
Roman Kent comprised—to wit, Noviomagus, Vagniacœ,
and Durolevum, the very sites of which are sturdily7
combated problems to this day. Along the entire
course of Hadrian's AA'all there is not a mile castle or a
supporting camp, much less a fortified town, of which the
position is not merely exactly known, but of which some
remains cannot be seen.


In B.C. 55 Julius Cæsar prepared for an expedition of
reconnaissance to Britain, a land which promised to be a
valuable addition to the Roman Empire, not only for its
commerce in metals and grain, but as a recruiting ground
for the Roman legions. Of the British tin trade, of course,
he had long been aware; his intercourse with Gaulish
merchants taught him the magnitude of the British grain
trade, and without doubt during his Gaulish campaigns he
had discovered the prowess of the stalwart, fearless
British warriors.


The Britons, who had probabl}7 received hints of Cæsar's
intended interference from their business friends over the
water, and who no doubt had heard of his renown, sent an
embassy. This was civilly received and was accompanied
home by an officer, Comius, who had instructions to keep
his eyes open, and, if possible, to induce the Britons to
become allies of his master—a very convenient arrange
ment for Cæsar, as he could then pursue the policy of the
Jutes of a later age and carry out his scheme of
colonisation under the plea of friendship without the worry
and expense of fighting.


At the same time Cæsar had sent Arolusenus to examine
the British Coast and report upon the best place for
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 12 -->
landing, for from the Gaulish traders, whom he specially
interviewed, he had learned nothing. Comius returned
with the report that the Britons, no doubt warned that
their fate would be the usual one of tribes who had been
induced to "ally" with Cæsar,were by no means enthusiastic
over the prospect of a Romano-British alliance.


Volusenus returned after five days' absence, but without
having been ashore, so that it may be surmised he brought
no valuable information.


At any rate on August 27th Cæsar started from Portus
Itius, which may be located at AA'issant, between Calais
and Boulogne, or at Boulogne itself according to French
archæologists, with two legions, numbering with auxiliaries
about 14,000 men, and in nine hours was off the Kentish
Coast.


Here he found the cliffs crowded with natives assembled
to oppose his landing, and, after calling a council of war,
he sailed seven or eight miles to an " apertum et planum
littus."


Here comes in the question—and for Kent people it is
an intensely interesting question : In wliich direction did
he sail these seven or eight miles 1


According to modern calculations based upon the
hypothesis that the Channel tides have not changed in
force and direction since Cæsar's day, the seven or eight
miles sail from Folkestone—for Folkestone answers to
Cæsar's description of the shore off which he first anchored
as well as does Dover—would have brought him opposite
almost exactly where now the ruins of Portus Lemannis
stretch down the hill side from Lympne church.


But with a south-westerly wind he might here as
reasonably been carried to where Deal Strand now is, in the
opposite direction, and, with all deference to the ably
argued view which places Cæsar's landing-spot between
Bulverhithe and St. Leonards in Sussex, our opinion goes
with the concensus, that about Deal is to be located the
arrival point of the Roman legions.  
  
  
  AVherever it was, the Britons were ready, and lost no
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 13 -->
time in impeding the process of landing as effectively
as possible. Severe fighting ensued which confirmed
Cæsar's advices that the Britons were skilful as well as
fearless warriors, but the tried discipline and superior
armament of the Romans prevailed, and it was only their
lack of cavalry which prevented them from utterly routing
the Britons.


Cæsar formed a camp and awaited a reinforcement of
cavalry without which he could not hope to checkmate the
guerrilla-like movements of his adversaries. The ships
came in sight, but were driven back to Gaul by contrary
winds. Nor was this all. It was harvest time, and men
of the Seventh Legion were engaged at some distance from
the camp in getting in the grain : they fell into an
ambuscade, and but for the timely arrival of reinforcements would
have been cut to pieces. Again, the Roman ignorance of
the great rise and fall of the tides on the British shores led
to the insecure mooring of the ships, so that when bad
weather came on, the fleet was severely damaged.


The prevalence of bad weather put an end to active
operations for some days, but at length Cæsar saw his
opportunity, sallied forth, completely rolled up the Britons,
and, being now reinforced by some cavalry, pursued them
and returned.


The Britons now sued for peace, which was granted, and
Cæsar, taking hostages with him, made sail for Gaul after a
campaign of twenty-five days.


Next year, u.c 54, Cæsar carried out a thoroughly
prepared plan of invasion. On July 20th he left Gaul with
600 ships carrying five legions, and 2,000 cavalry, the
latter principally Batavians famous at swimming rivers,
probably a force of 35,000 men, and landed, it is supposed,
at the same spot as before.


He marched inland at once and at a distance of about
twelve miles—" millia passuum circiter duodecim "—came
in sight of the enemy on the banks of a river. It is
impossible to say with any degree of probability what river it
was,
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 14 -->

From as minute a personal examination of the country7
as its difficult character will permit, we are inclined to
agree very closely with Mr. Jenkins in the supposition
that Chilham was the scene of Cæsar's first battle in his
second expedition.


Nor are we by any means inclined to sneer as unworthy
of acceptation the derivation of the modern name of the
ancient barrow on the invaders' side of the river,
Julaberry's Grave, from Laberius, the Roman tribune who fell
in the battle here. True, his name was Quintus Durus, but
there is a good deal in the last three syllables of the
popular name which is at any rate suggestive. It does not
seem to us at all improbable that, in a sequestered, thinly
inhabited country such as this around Chilham was, the
name of a famous foeman killed in battle should have
been handed down from century to century7 until at this
long distance of two thousand years it should still exist in
a scarcely altered form.


The rustic in general, and the Kentish rustic in
partieu'ar, has never given play to much fancy in the
christening of places, and has been quite content to call
anything he knows nothing about in the way of ruin, or
cromlech, or mound, or earthwork, after Cæsar or the Devil, both
being the same sort of toiler without rhyme or reason in
his estimation. AVherever a peculiar name is given to such
objects as we have enumerated, the science of historical or
antiquarian research is pretty sure to get at some probable
fact in support of its etymolog}7, and had we space at our
command we could give many instances in support of our
statement.


Here we have a name the nearest approach to which may
be found in the Julian's Bowers scattered about our
country, and which is not to be explained away unquestioned as
having anything to do with Selebert or the origin of the
name Chilham itself.


At any rate, Cæsar fought a battle and stormed a
stronghold which may have been according to divers opinionists
Burg AA*ood by Hurst Green in Sussex, or the oppidum at
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 15 -->
Kingston, or that on Patrixbourne Hill, or Grove Ferry, or
Bursted near Lower Hardres, or Iffin's AA'ood near
Canterbury, but which we prefer to think was Chilham.


AA e know, as surely one can know about such antiquities,
that Chilham was an important British stronghold; that
when Sir Dudley Digges excavated in building his house
here in 1610 he found many Roman relics; and, as Mr.
Jenkins points out, the polygonal shape of Chilham Keep is
distinctly Roman.


Cæsar fortified himself in the captured oppidum after he
had driven its defenders out. AA'hilst thus engaged the
news was brought him that a violent storm had almost
completely wrecked the fleet off Deal, so he returned and
with characteristic energy at once started the work of
refitting.  
  
  
  'o*


The Britons, hearing of the straits in which was their
enemy, assembled under their prince Caswallon, better
known as Cassivelaunus. and fortified themselves in the
oppidum which we place at Shottenden, but which Mr.
Vine considers to have been at Key Coll Hill near
Canterbury. Here the Romans did not gain a great victory even
if they did not suffer actual repulse, but evidently* they
regained their lost laurels, and the Britons retreated.


Cæsar's next movements are topographically indistinct.
AA'hat we know is that he pursued the retreating Britons,
crossed a river, and attacked and took the town of
Cassivelaunus. If he proceeded northwards—be it from
Chilham or from near Canterbury7, he must have got into
Sheppey. If, as we dare to think, he followed the Britons
along their trackway, he would have crossed the Thames,
and would have come to London, which certainly best
answers to the description of the capital of Cassivelaunus
to which Cæsar did not even condescend to give a name—
protected on the North by a vast forest full of wild beasts,
and on the south by marshes.


AVhere he crossed is one of these questions about this
period which will always remain unsolved. All we know
is that the ford was eighty miles from the sea. If it was
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 16 -->
at the Coway Stakes—wliich, by7 the way, are evidently the
remains of a bridge—he must either have for strategical or
other reasons have gone a great deal out of a direct line, or
our notions of the topography of this campaign are entirely
at fault.


Cassivelaunus finding that his ill-disciplined, ill-armed
troops were no match for the Romans at close fighting, had
recourse to guerrilla tactics, but finally Cæsar got him at
bay, perhaps in the Wimbledon Camp, and the failure of
the attack by the four " Kings " of Kent on the Coast
Camp, coupled with the submission of the Trinobantes to
Cæsar, compelled him to surrender.


Cæsar gladly came to terms, for domestic sorrow and
cares of state were calling him back to Rome, whilst his
success in this campaign, which we thoroughly believe was
conducted in Kent, was very poorly balanced by the cost,
and, after imposing an annual tribute and receiving
hostages, he sailed for Gaul. No part of Britain was
really conquered. Both Horace and Tibullus speak of the
\"unsubdued Britons," and- Tacitus remarks that Cæsar
merely showed the way to those who came after him.


For nearly a century the state of affairs in Europe
distracted the attention of the Romans from Britain, for
the puerilities of Caligula are unworthy of notice. In
{empty}a.d. 43 some difficulty about a British fugitive from
justice at Rome brought about an expedition under Aulus
Plautius.


He landed, it is thought at Porchester, with 50,000 men,
and met with no opposition, either because the Britons
were divided amongst themselves, or because the memory
of previous contests with the Romans had taught them to
avoid fights in the open.


The history of the campaign is very dim, but it would
seem that the Romans pursued the Britons into their
woods and marshes, and round by the Cotswolds to a part
of the Thames where " it empties itself into the ocean and
becomes an estuary at high water." Aulus Plautius is
supposed to have crossed into Essex from Kent by the
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 17 -->
Causeway at Higham, still existing, and known to be
Roman, on the way defeating the two sons of Cunobelin,
Caractacus and Togidumnus, and scattering the tribe of
Dobuni or Boduni.


The want of knowledge about this campaign is much to
be regretted, for it was evidently, from the extent of new
country embraced, a very big affair, and really was the
foundation of the Roman Colony of Britain. All we
know is that at length the Roman general found himself
in an awkward position in a country of forest and marsh,
and, in obedience to instructions, after intrenching himself,
perhaps in the great oppidum at Holwood, he sent to
Claudius for help. Claudius came, took Camalodunum,
the modern Colchester or Chesterford, the capital of the
late King Cunobelin, and conducted a successful campaign
which earned him a triumph.


The subsequent history of Roman rule in England in no
way affects Kent, which seems to have settled down to
peaceful, prosperous, industrial life, and to have become a
favourite residential district for Roman officials.


AA'e started with the statement that Cæsar's main object
in conquering Britain had been to make money out of her.


The southern part had been long linked to the
civilised world by commercial ties. It is believed that
many hundred y*ears before Christ the Phenicians carried
on a tin trade with her, it is known that the Greeks
succeeded them, and that the Romans succeeded the
Greeks. The Kentish folk were no barbarians of the
kind "pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw;" they
knew the value of money; Sir John Evans says that they
minted in the second century before Christ gold coins
modelled on Greek coins of the age of Pythias, and that in
30 B.C. they had gold coins stamped with letters. Besides
tin, Britain exported slaves, hunting dogs, lead, coin and
skins, and Mr. Boyd Dawkins thinks, possibly worked the
iron ore of the Weald. In return they received brass,
pottery, glass and ivory. Britain was also a valuable
recruiting ground, not merely for the legions, but for the  
  
  
  c
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 18 -->
amphitheatre, and our forefathers were always remarkable
for stature, strength and agility.


Corn growing, pottery making, and possibly iron
smelting, were the chief Kentish industries during the
Roman period. The North Kentish shore from Faversham
to Rochester was under the Roman dominion one vast
potter's field, and at the present day the marshes of the
Medway below Upchurch and extending from Otterham
Creek nearly to Chitney, are full of Roman remains in
the shapes of pottery banks, and traces of the life of the
workers.


The peculiar bluish black Upchurch ware, although not
so fine in quality nor so elaborately ornamented as that
manufactured along the banks of the Nen in
Northamptonshire and known as Caister ware, was evidently much
esteemed, as specimens of it have been found, not only at
some of the remotest stations in Britain, but on the
continent. A pottery for ware of a finer kind has been
discovered at Dymchurch. The immense quantity of
pseudo-Samian ware unearthed in different parts of our
island has suggested the existence of manufactories in
Britain, but it is now considered to have been made in Gaul.
A large amount has been dredged up from time to time at
the Pan Sands between Margate and Reculver, a fact which
points to the wreck here of a vessel laden with pottery.


The whole of this country of marshes and creeks, which
by the way is believed in Roman times to have been dry7
land protected by embankments, must have been the seat
of a very large industrial population, for the demand for
pottery was enormous, as is proved by excavations all
over the country which show that the Romans employed
pots for many uses to which we are unaccustomed, notably
in connection with their funeral ceremonies, and as
receptacles for money and treasure. Associated with this
industrial class was another of proprietors and employers,
and the private dwellings of these extended along the
banks of the Medway and Darenth, as well as being in the
neighbourhoods of the large towns on the line of Watling
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 19 -->
Street. Of the Roman iron industry in Kent there are but
few traces, for it never could compare with that in the
Sylva Anderida across the Sussex border, but remains of
furnaces and ash heaps have been found near Cowden and
Frittenden, and there was perhaps a furnace at Lyminge.
Chalk was dug at Dartford and Cray ford and exported,
and Hasted states that in Zealand have been found
altars dedicated to the goddess of the Kentish chalk
workers.


Sheppey, Thanet, the river valleys, and the cleared
uplands, were the Kentish grain districts : Solinus speaks
of Thanet as Frumentariis campis felix et yleba uberi*
Gibbon writing of the reign of Julian, about a.d. 350, says
that six hundred large barks made several voyages to the
coast of Britain and returned from thence laden with corn.
\"If " says he, " we compute the 600 cornships of Julian
at only 70 tons each, they were capable of exporting
120,000 quarters of grain."


It is some small consolation for us who grumble at our
modern climate, and who sigh for " good old-fashioned
weather," to hear that Pythias the Greek merchant from
Marseilles, who landed in Britain during the fourth
century before Christ, remarked that the British farmers
were obliged to thresh their grain under cover because of
the uncertainty of the weather.


AA'e may now briefly examine the principal Roman
remains in Kent, and for convenience may thus classify
them; (1) Fortresses. (2) Earthworks. (3) Roads. (4)
Various.

(I)—Fortresses.


There were three Castra—Rutupice,—Richborough,
Regulbium—Reculver, and Portus Lemannis—Lympne.


There were three walled towns—Dubris, Dover;
Durovernum, Canterbury; and Durobrivœ, Rochester.


About the sites of three other important stations
controversy still rages. These were Vagniacœ, claimed by
Maidstone, Southfleet, and with the greatest show of
reason, Springhead near Northfleet; Noviomagus—ten  
  
  
  C 2
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 20 -->
miles from London according to the itineraries—claimed
by Keston, by Crayford, by AA'oodcote in Surrey, but
probably on the Watling Street; and Durolevum, claimed
by Syndale, near Faversham, by Lenham and by the
neighbourhood of Ospringe.


Of only two of these are remains at all considerable—
of Rutupiœ and of Portus Lemannis : of Regulbium only
part of the South and East walls remain, whilst the
remains of Durovernum and Durobrivœ consist entirely of
pavements, foundations and so forth which are unearthed
from beneath the streets of the modern cities, and those of
Roman Dubris of the work in the Pharos and the church in
the Castle.
(II)—Earthworks.

What we call Roman earthworks are almost in every
case Roman adaptations of British oppicla of fortifications.
There is probably not in the county a single camp of
Roman origin in the sense that the camps North and
South of Hadrian's Wall and others are Roman. The best
known because best preserved are the camps at Holwood,
Oldbury, Shottenden, Ewell, Judds Hill near Eaversham,
Fossberry, Lingfield Mark, Castle Hill near
Tonbridge, Postling, the Camp Hill behind Folkestone, the
works on Barham Downs and on the hills round about;
others such as the works in Bigberry and Iffin's Woods
near Canterbury, Penny Pot Wood near Chilham, Syndale
near Faversham, and Blackheath, were probably merely
temporarily occupied by the Romans unless we accept
Syndale to be Durolevum. It is by excavation alone that
we can arrive at any probable conclusions concerning
earthworks.
(Ill) Roads.

There are so many undoubted Roman Roads, or
British trackways adapted by the Romans in Kent, that
we can only deal with the principal. These were the
Watling Street from London to Dover, still with a few
deviations the main road of Kent; the Stone Street from
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 21 -->
Lympne to Canterbury,—a perfectly straight line still
except where Monks Horton Park causes a bend; a
straight road Northwards from Dover to AVoodnesborough,
whence originally it ran to East End, in Roman times on
the shore opposite Richborough island; a road from
Richborough via Fleet to Canterbury7, and a road from
Canterbury to Reculver.


There was also without doubt a great main road from
the Camp in Holwood Park, via Oldbury and Maidstone
into the Sylva Anderida, perhaps to Anderida itself; a
road from Rochester to Maidstone, and perhaps one from
Maidstone to Lympne. Possibly the great main road
first mentioned in its length between Holwood and
Maidstone acted as a winter relief-road to AVatling Street,
as the latter for many miles runs through a country which
in those times must have been almost under water during
rainy seasons, the line joining AVatling Street by Key
Street west of Sittingbourne.


From the frequent discovery of Roman remains along
the line of what is now known as the Pilgrims' AA'ay to
Canterbury from Surrey and South AA'est England, it is
conjectured that this too was used by the Romans, but
it cannot be classed amongst Roman roads proper. The
\"Pilgrims' AA'ay " was the British Road right through the
counts}7. As for the subordinate roads—viœ vicinedes,
branch roads; agrariœ, country roads; and device,
byroads, their name is legion, and it is a remarkable instance
of the tenacious longevity of tradition that to this day
many of them are known to the country folk as Roman
roads.

(IV)—Various Remains.


Notwithstanding our knowledge that Kent under Roman
rule was on the whole the centre of greater wealth and
refinement than any other count}7, yve are faced by the
fact that the evidences of this are comparatively small.
No such luxurious country palaces as the villas at
AVoodchester, at Bignor, and at Brading have been unearthed
in Kent. AA'e have no wealth of tesselated pavements,
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 22 -->
sculpture, architectural decoration, and personal
adornment, such as have been disinterred from London and a
score of places in the country. Altars and inscribed
stones are almost unknown. And yet we must believe
that Roman Canterbury and Rochester and Maidstone
and Richborough were as much the homes of wealthy,
refined and leisured people as were York and Colchester,
and L3icester and Silchester, and AVroxeter and Cirencester,
and the cities along the AA'all.


A glance through the index of the Roman Collection
of the Kent Archæological Society in the Maidstone
Museum will reveal the fact that at one place alone,
Richborough, have a few pieces of sculpture and architectural
ornament been found. Kent, however, abounded with
villas. Of those the best known are those at Hartlip, at
AVingham, ut and round about Maidstone, at AA'estbere,
and last but by no means least, the fine house unearthed
at Darenth in 1894 by Mr. Payne.


At all these villas interesting relics have been found;
and, to use Mr. Payne's words, "all things conducive to
comfort, healtli, and enjoyment" seem to have abounded,
but they seem to have been the residences of successful
officials and men of business, rather than of virtuosos and
gentlemen of leisure. Air. Payne has recorded the sites of
50 villas in his survey, of which only some half-dozen have
been touched.


Of temples and religious edifices we can only call to
mind the Mithraic temples at Durham, and near Mottenden,
and the small fragment at the top of the AVar Bank at
Keston, but in Roman funerary remains Kent is rich.
Cemeteries line the roads leading from all the sites of
Roman towns, are hidden away in what are now woods and
coppices, abound in the brick-fields near the Sittingbourne
and Faversham marshes, and are sometimes mingled with
the Saxon grave-sites.


A\'e may presume to account for the comparative
meagreness of our Kentish Roman general relics by the fact that
the flood of civilisation rolled and settled over Kent at an
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 23 -->
earlier period than over other English counties. There
are no isolated Roman towns "in Kent such as Cilurnum
and Borcovicus in Northumberland, or Silchester in
Hampshire, or AVroxeter in Shropshire, for without doubt
Noviomagus, Durolevum and Vagniacœ lie buried beneath
modern hives of life, just as Roman Rochester and
Canterbury lie beneath modern Rochester and Canterbury, and
could we burrow under Rochester and Canterbury as men
have burrowed under Torre del Greco and exposed
Herculaneum, we cannot doubt but that we should light upon
remains as magnificent as have been unearthed anywhere
in Britain.


With permission I may conclude with some remarks by
Mr. Payne upon the subject of Roman Kent. He says :
\"The archæologists of the present day, who are worthy of
the name, do not jump at conclusions, but deal only with
facts, such facts being brought before the highest
authorities ere they become matters of history.


\"The statements of the older historians, so far as
PreNorman remains are concerned, must be respected, but
received with caution. They had not the great advantages
we have; and they did not see the gigantic importance of
excavating to prove or disprove their theories. AA'edothis
so far as we can; brickmakers and quarrymen do the rest.
Roman Kent can only be written as illustrated by the
discoveries already made."  
  
  
  NOTE.—THE LANDING PLACE OF CESAR.


The late Astronomer Royal argued upon scientific grounds for
I*eveiisey, twelve miles from which would have brought Cæsar to
Robertsbridge on the Rother, if he followed, as he probably would,
especially as it was a night march, a native trackway.


If as Mr. Hussey argues, likewise upon scientific grounds, that
Cæsar landed between Bulverhithe and St. Leonards, twelve miles
would have taken him near no river at all.


If as Mr. Lewin argues, he landed at Lympne, a twelve mile
march along the trackwaj*, afterwards made into the Roman Stone
Stteet, would certainly not, as Mr. Lewin says it would, have
brought Cæsar to Wye or anywhere near it.
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 24 -->

The concensus of modern opinion seems to be that Cæsar landed
in quite an opposite direction—at or about Deal, and this is based
upon the very rational supposition that he might just as well have
been carried eight miles by the wind in one direction as by the tide
in another.


From Deal no satisfactory site for the battle wllich followed can
be found wliich corresponds with Cæsar's express statement that it
was fought on the banks of a river, if we accept literally the
measurement of twelve miles.


Twelve miles due west from Deal would bring us to Barham
Downs, and here, at Kingston, the Emperor Napoleon, who is
followed by Mr. Vine, places the site of the battle, Cæsar's route
having been by the British trackway through Upper Deal,
Knowlton, Goodnestone and Adisham, whence he saw the Britons lining
the crest of Barham Downs.


But why are we to conclude that because Cæsar sighted the
Britons after a twelve mile inarch, the}* were posted at a spot
twelve miles from the sea?


A twelve mile march at night through a difficult and dense
country would not have been finished before daylight, and Cæsar
might perfectly well in this countiy of hills have first sighted the
enemy at five, six or seven miles distance.


Again, we read that the enemj* retreated as far as the river, which
means to a defensive position, and here the Napoleon-Vine theofy
falls to pieces.


There is no evidence that the diminutive stream which runs
tlirough Bourne and Charlton Parks was ever bigger than it is now,
and even if we grant that it was we must remember that it was
midsummer, and that it could not have been of a width and depth
to be considered a strategic obstacle.


But if we assume—and we are all bound to assume in a case like
this; even the scientific theorists have to assume that the Channel
tides were two thousand years ago exactly the same as they are
now—if we assume that the Britons were sighted by Cæsar about
twenty miles from the coast, we seem to be able to imagine the
campaign which followed with very tolerable reasonableness.


The river we then get is the Stonr, which we know was many
hundred years after Cæsar's day navigable as far as the " port " of
Chilham; Cæsar's position is on the hills about Penny Pot and
Kettle Benden; and the Biitons are under the shadow of the
oppidum upon which was to rise Chilham Castle.

  THE KINGDOM OF KENT.  
  
  
  PREFATORY.


It will be observed that we speak of Hengist and
Horsa, of Vortigern, Catigern, Vortimer, and of their
contemporaries as historical personages. This we do, not
in a settled belief in their existence as makers of history,
but for convenience. It is impossible with the scanty
materials at hand to ascertain when, in the history of
these dim, early days of our country, fiction ends and truth
begins. At any rate no more harm is done by assuming
for the sake of clearness and convenience that Hengist and
his contemporaries were real beings of flesh and blood than
there is in firmly believing that Cinderella's slipper was of
glass and not of " vair," that King Arthur, and AVhittington,
and Robin Hood were real beings and not mere types, and
that Wellington really said " Up Guards and at 'em !" at
Waterloo.


Moreover there is no reason for doubting the existence
of these our early conquerors and patriots, other than the
absolute lack of reliable records of their times. They were
not giants or magicians : they did nothing improbable :
their arrival and their subsequent proceedings fit in
admirably with what we know must have been their
surroundings : above all, tradition, general and local, gives
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 26 -->
them places in history, and tradition, as every historical
student, every antiquary, and every archæologist knows,
is not merely not to be despised, but is often of great aid.


At the same time, we repeat, our treatment of Hengist
and his contemporaries as historical beings is not to be
interpreted as unqualified belief in them as such.


A writer in the Archeeologia in support of a theory that
Vortigern and not Hengist was the real subduer of the
Britons quotes the Historia Miscella of Paulus Diaconus,
the Lombard historian who wrote almost as early as Bede,
and attributes the substitution of Hengist for Vortigern to
the pride of the Jutes in a later day when they7 had
attained position and power, which induced them to
glorify one of their own race at the expense of truth.


I have been called to task for speaking of peoples who
called themselves English as Anglo-Saxons. Again the
plea of convenience must be urged and accepted. If
through all the early fightings and operations between the
natives and their invaders strict adherence was held to the
term " Britons " for the one, and " English " for the other,
in what an irremediable, hopeless muddle the student's
mind would be ! Besides, they may have called themselves
what they liked, but the fact remains that they came from
Saxony and Angle-land, nnd that Anglo-Saxon describes
them very sufficiently.
<!-- Leaf 45 -->
  
  III.—THE KINGDOM OF KENT.

TN Appendix A will be found sufficient evidence to

sustain the claim of our County above all others, with

the exception, of course, of London, to be considered

as par excellence the Royal County. This name is now
generally given to Berkshire simply because Windsor
Castle happens to be in Berkshire, but, apart from the
reasons given in the Appendix, Kent was once a Royal
County in the truest sense of the phrase inasmuch as it
was a Kingdom.


AVith the end of the Roman rule the real history of
Kent may7 be said to begin. AA*e are on comparatively
firm ground, and can sometimes say with some degree of
certainty that such an event happened, and that such a
person did this or that thing, whereas, about the Roman
period, as we have before remarked, there is a great deal
that can only be guessed at, a great deal of which we can
only speak as probable, and a great deal more about which
we know nothing at all. Not that there would have been
much to record in history about a colony under military
despotism, but the land of our birth and residence has
always a claim upon our affection strong enough to make
us curious about the life of those whose home it was, even
if they were but slaves.


The last Roman soldier was withdrawn from Britain
about a.d. 413, but for more than a century later Rome
regarded Britain as part of her empire, and it was even
granted by Belisarius to the Goths as a sop. Practically
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 28 -->
the land was left to itself, and in as helpless and miserable
a condition as can be imagined.


If it be asked what impress did the Mistress of the
Ancient AA'orld leave upon her Northernmost Colony, the
answer is practically Nothing.


As Mr. Norman remarks in a paper in our Archæologia,
\"It is somewhat remarkable that while Spain and Gaul
were thoroughly Romanised, generally adopted the
language of their conquerors; were studded with splendid
cities, and produced many men distinguished in the career
of literature, nothing similar seems to have happened in
Britain."


It is impossible to say if any racial traces wrought by the
intermarriage of Roman and Briton were observable when
Hengist and Horsa landed in Kent, as, after so long an
acquaintance as four hundred years, one might expect,
although some modern ethnologists have imagined that
here and there to this day, notably in one corner of Sussex
and in the country about King's Lynn in Norfolk, Roman
blood is discernible in the appearance of the inhabitants.


Assuredly however Hengist and Horsa found Kent in a
more civilised, if not more prosperous, condition than she
was destined to enjoy for many years after. At the same
time it appears that this civilisation was very partial. It
was confined to the towns and centres where the Roman
tongue alone prevailed, and the bulk of the population,
although completely under Roman rule, lived their own
life, and even enjoyed their own forms of social
government. It must be emphasised too that the Roman
system of colonisation, wliich was a purely military
despotism, had knocked out of the natives all capacity for
independent, sturdy action, if not their physical pluck.
Britons fought in the Roman legions, but never were
permitted to rise from the ranks; and we may be quite
sure that there was none of the respect and enthusiasm
amongst them for the eagle, which, existing so strongly as
they do amongst soldiers of all creeds and colours for the
British flag, is so marvellous and striking a testimony in
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 29 -->
favour of our colonial system. So in civil life. British
merchants perhaps prospered and made money, but they do
not seem ever to have been permitted to share civil
dignities with their Roman companions.


It was this want of cohesion, this division of the
abandoned island into two communities so distinct as
almost to be regarded as foreigners to each other—the
Romanised Britons of the towns, and the native rural
population—which laid the land open and defenceless to
the Northern invader who had only been kept in check by
the Roman arms. Directly the protecting hand was
withdrawn the vultures came down on their prey, and
the period between the departure of the Romans and the
arrival of the Jutes is the darkest in our history because it
is absolutely without annals. All we know is that the Picts,
who had been kept within bounds by the garrisons of
Hadrian's AA'all, just as the Scandinavians had been kept
in check by the Count of the Saxon shore, swooped down
upon the land and carried fire and sword to its very heart.
With these came the Scots from Ireland, and so when
Aetius, the Roman Governor of Gaul, found it impossible
to answer the pathetic appeal embodied in the " Groans of
the Britons," help had to be looked for elsewhere.


This was in 443, Vortigern being King of Kent. In
despair Vortigern turned for help to foemen, promising
them lands and pay in return for services rendered, making
use of one race of pests to rid himself of others, and in so
doing strictly following the Roman custom of employing
"fœderati"


Three tribes of the Cimbrian people occupied the North
AVest Coast of what is now Germany, from the mouths of
the Rhine to the Peninsula of Denmark. These were the
Jutes, the Saxons, and the Angles, known to the Romans
as Saxons, and by themselves called English. The Saxons
lived on the narrow neck of the Denmark Peninsula and
about the mouth of the Elbe, and with them were the
Frisians. Their land is now Schleswig-Holstein. North
of the Saxons lived the Angles, and beyond them, in what
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 30 -->
is still Jutland, the Jutes. To this last people, no
strangers to the land which called to them for aid,
Vortigern appealed, and in 445 Hengist aud Horsa landed
in " three long ships" at Stonar, so say the latest
examiners of the question; at Ebbsfleet, so say nine people
out of ten who will not easily give up the creed of their
fathers, erroneous as it may be.


From 445 to 452 Jutes and Britons fought side by side
against Picts and Scots and with success. All the time
however Hengist was quietly turning Thanet into a
Jutish colony and recruiting his forces from the mother
country, intimate enough with Vortigern to give him his
daughter Rowena as wife, and craftily lulling him into the
most unsuspecting security7, until he saw the time ripe for
the development of his long-cherished plan.


In 452 Hengist threw off the mask, and made some
trivial dispute about the payment of his ever increasing
bands of warriors, an excuse to burst out of Thanet, seize
the fortresses at Richborough and Reculver before
Vortigern could make any resistance, march on to
Canterbury, wllich he burned, and continue towards
London.


Whether his further progress was barred by the Roman
walls of Rochester, or whether he was tempted aside by
the riches of the Medway Valle\*, but he suddenly
marched southwards, along the line of the hills, past what
was probably then the mound covering the stones of Kits
Coty House, and so down to the river at Aylesford.


Here in 455 he met the Britons under A'ortigern. A
terrible fight ensued—terrible as may7 be imagined
between two leaders one of whom was fighting for a
kingdom and the other for self-preservation—which ended
in the utter rout of the Britons. Horsa and Catigern
the son of Vortigern met in single combat, so says
tradition in this land full of tradition, much of which may
be accepted as history, and both fell. Catigern, it is said,
was laid beneath Kits Coty House, whilst the village of
Horsted on the road to Chatham is said to mark the
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 31 -->
burial place of his rival. Mr. Payne says that a stone
structure of the Cromlech type stood here in former times,
and that when Fort Horsted was built it was destroyed.
This traditionally7 marked Horsa's tomb.


After this victory Hengist declaied himself King of
Kent, but that his dominion was as easily kept as it was
won must not be imagined; his was but the commencement
of a subjugation which was to occupy sixty y*ears, and
every hour of his reign was employed in attacking and
being attacked, in burnings, slayings, and destroyings.
In 457 there was another bloody battle, at Crayford,
resulting as did Aylesford in the defeat of the Britons.


Through the cloud which hangs over this miserable
period we can only discern that there seems to have been
a great revolt of the Britons under Vortimer, son of
Vortigern, acting as general under Aurelius Ambrosianus,
a Romanised Briton, Count of the Saxon shore, and that
after three great battles fought at Derwent in AA'est Kent,
at Stonar—the Stone of the Title—and at AA'ippedsfleet,
the Jutes were driven into Thanet in 456. The locality of
the last battle is by no means certain. Tradition says that
it was fought between Hythe and Folkestone, and that
the bones now in the crypt of the former church, and
those formerly in the latter church are the remains of the
Britons and Jutes who fell in the fight. (See Note A at end
of Chapter).


Until 405 we know nothing of what happened, and
we may suppose that Hengist and his Jutes remained shut
up in Thanet; but in this year Hengist won a great
victory over the Britons at AA'ippedsfleet, in which " twelve
AA'elsh aldermen were slain," and recaptured Richborough
and Reculver. In 473 another victory firmly established
him on the Kentish throne with his son Esc as partner.


It is necessary here for the sake of continuity to follow
briefly the history of the Saxons who, hearing of the
successful issue of Hengist's enterprise in Kent, thought
that a kingdom in Britain might be theirs also. Accordingly,
in 477, came Cymen to Selsea Bill in Sussex, and landed
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 32 -->
at Cymen's Ora, still perhaps recognisable in the name
Keynor, just as Lancing, Cissbury, and perhaps Chiehester
reflect the names of his sons AVlencing and Cissa. But
the Andredswald—the Black country of Britain, was
\"up," and its sturdy miners offered such a resistance that
it was not until Anderida—known to us as Pevensey, had
been after a terrible struggle captured and utterly
destroyed that the Saxon conquest could be called complete
and not until 495 was the kingdom of the South Saxons
established. Between 495 and 508 other bands of Saxons
landed, it is supposed at Porchester, and these, who are
known as the AA'est Saxons, were constantly engaged for
ten years in conflict with the Britons who seemed to have
formed an alliance with the Jutes of the Isle of Wight.
In 521 the West Saxon kingdom was established under
Cerdic and Cynric, and without detailing matters wliich
have no immediate, although an important general, relation
to the Kingdom of Kent, it maj- be said that the West
Saxons pushed their way Westward and Northward
until Hampshire and AViltshire were conquered, and with
the fall of Calleva, the modern Silchester, the valley of the
Thames lay open, the flank of the great AA'ealden forest
was, so to speak, turned, and there was nothing between
the invaders and London. This was accomplished by 556.
Of Kent and its Jutish conquerors we hear nothing until
the time of Ethelbert, the great-grandson of Hengist, who
ascended the throne in 564, and we may surmise that,
protected by the almost impassable character of its
natural boundaries, the little kingdom gradually7 recovered
from the utter desolation which accompanied the Jutish
conquest, that commercial intercourse was resumed with
the Continent, and that people slowly began to re-inhabit
the Roman towns which had remained deserted, ruined
objects of superstitous awe. How absolutely cities like
Canterbury and Rochester had been destroyed is evident
if we compare plans of those cities as we know them with
the plans of them under Roman rule as evinced by the
traces of walls and buildings, and note how even the lines
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 33 -->
of the Roman streets were obliterated by the time the first
bold men forsook the habit of building outside the heaps
of Roman ruins and commenced to build over and amongst
the ruins themselves. But so slowly did this work of
repopulation progress that it was not for another three
hundred years that the entire area was covered with
buildings.


Ethelbert, partly alarmed at the progress of Cynric and
his West Saxons towards the Northern boundary of his
kingdom, and partly perhaps ambitious to extend his
domains, marched to meet them. He found them
entrenched on Wimbledon Common, no doubt in the old
British oppidum known as Cæsar's Camp, fought them and
was most thoroughly thrashed. This was in 568, and the
battle of AA'imbledon is notable as being the first fight on
English ground between Englishmen.


In 583 or 584 Ethelbert married Bertha, daughter of
Charibert, King of Paris, a Christian, and with her she
brought a chaplain, Liudhard, bishop of Senlis, for whose
use the ruined church of Saint Martin at Canterbury,
which had been, it is now almost universally agreed, a
Roman Christian temple, was repaired and set apart.


This event, the most important in the history of Kent,
and one of the most important in the history of England,
leads us to consider briefly what Christianity there had
been in Britain.


Tradition attributes the first introduction of Christianity
into England to a King Lucius of Kent, about a.d. 160,
but as the very existence of this King Lucius is questioned,
until more is discovered it is safe to relegate him to the
world of myths along with the traditions about St. Paul,
St. Bran the Blessed, father of Caractacus, Joseph of
Arimathea at Glastonbury, and so forth. Christian
Missionaries from Gaul are however known to have landed
in Britain during the Second Century, and to have made
some progress amongst the town-dwellers, but very little
amongst the rude bulk of rustics.  
  
  
  We may also believe that when the Roman Christian  
  
  
  D
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 34 -->
Emperor Constantine was crowned at York in 309,
Christianity became not merely the tolerated but the
recognised religion of the land, and it is from now that we
may perhaps date the relics bearing Christian inscriptions
and monograms which have been unearthed from time to
time at widely different parts of the country, such as
Dorsetshire, the Thames, Gloucestershire, Northumberland,
Silchester, and also the building of or the adaptation of
the churches of St. Martin and St. Pancras at Canterbury,
and perhaps those at Reculver and at Brixworth in
Hampshire. Under DiocletianSt. Alban is said to have
been martyred near the town which bears his name,
although Diocletian's Governor in Britain was the tolerant
Constantius. In 314 three British bishops are said to
have been present at the Council of Aries, and Athanasius
speaks of three British bishops being present at his trial
at the Council of Sardis in 353. AVhen the first invaders
landed from the Schleswig shores they found Britain
Christian, but between that date and the y7ear of
Ethelbert's marriage the religion was utterly swept from
the land. Gibbon says : "After the destruction of the
principal churches the bishops, who had declined the
crown of martyrdom, retired with the hoh7 relics into
AVales and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were
left destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even
the remembrance of Christianity were abolished; and the
British clergy might obtain some comfort from the
damnation of the idolatrous strangers."


Devon, Cornwall and AVest AA'ales became the refuges
of British Christianity, and although the real conversion
of Cornwall by missionaries from Ireland only7 dates from
the fifth century, the Christian religion has prevailed there
for fourteen hundred years uninterruptedly. It was this
toleration by7 Ethelbert of Christianity which instigated
the great Pope Gregory to send Augustine as a missionary7
to Britain.


In 597 he landed in Kent, whether at Ebbsfleet, or at
Richborough, or at Stonar is immaterial. The King,
<!-- Leaf 58 -->

<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P58_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 35 -->
after some hesitation, was converted, thousands of his
countrymen followed his example and were baptised.
(See Note B at end of Chapter). The ancient Roman
Christian Church of St. Pancras, " the idol house where
King Ethelbert according to the rites of his tribe was
wont to pray, and with his nobles to sacrifice to his
demons," as the fourteenth century Benedictine Thorn
writes, was cleansed and purged and dedicated by
Augustine to St. Pancras; and later on the King, with all
a proselyte's zeal, gave Augustine a building eastward of
the Roman City limits wliich he had used as his own
palace, and which was the precursor of the present
magnificent Cathedral. This was followed by the building
of the Monastery7 of SS. Peter and Paul, designed as a
burial place for Kings and Abbots, which gradually became
known by the name of its founder, and later on as St.
Augustine's Abbey, actually rivalled the Cathedral in
magnificence, and of which the Gateway, put to sadly base
uses at the beginning of this century, still exists.


The establishment of Christianity in Kent brought that
Kingdom into active intercourse with the Continent, and
raised it to an equality with the powers thereof, and, to
quote Mr. Green, " the civilisation, the arts, the letters
which had fled before the sword of the English Conqueror,
returned with the Christian faith."


In 604 the bishopric of Rochester was established,
subordinate to Canterbury it is true, but indicating that
even under Ethelbert the division between East and AVest
Kent, between the Men of Kent and the Kentishmen, was
a real one almost amounting to the division between two
separate States (See Note C at end of Chapter); and,
moreover, illustrating that so intimate was the connection
between Church and State in these early days of
our Christianity that the bounds of States came to be
defined by the bounds of episcopal dioceses. Hence, the
armoured ecclesiastic was now, and continued to be for
another seven hundred years, a familiar figure on the
battlefield, and the war story of our country, more  
  
  
  p3
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 36 -->
especially that of the Northern Counties and the Border,
rings with the deeds of clerical strategists and fighters.


In the meanwhile Ethelbert, quieted down after his
reverse at Wimbledon to the development of his own little
Kingdom, saw in the disunion and disorganisation of his
great rival AA'essex the long looked for opportunity of
extending the boundaries of Kent beyond the Andredswald
and the Thames. Such success attended his arms that by
the year of his conversion, 597, the Kingdom of Kent
extended from the Humber in the North, across the
Midlands to Sherwood, down to Huntingdon, by the
Western Borders of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire to the
Thames, thence by the East Border of Surrey and the
AVest Border of Sussex to the sea. Ethelbert was lord
therefore over the AVest, Middle and South Angles, the
East Angles, the East, Middle and South Saxons, and
Kent formed one of the three great divisions of the land,
the other two being AVessex and Northumbria. The
severing of this large domain commenced in East Anglia,
Redwald, the titular King, who had married Ethelbert's
sister Ricca, had consented to become, or probably7 was
commanded to become, a Christian. His people, however,
refused to follow his example, and so by way of compromise
he placed the altars of Christian worship amongst the
idols of popular worship. This sort of half-and-half action
of course did not suit Ethelbert; a series of conflicts
between over-lord and vassal ensued, which ended in the
open revolt of the latter. The flame of disaffection spread
with such fierceness and rapidity that by the year 616,
when Ethelbert died, all that remained were Essex,
Middlesex and Kent itself, and in the same year Sibert,
the titular King of the East Saxons, who had married
Ethelbert's daughter and become Christian, threw off both
authority and religion, and Kent shrunk again to the
dimensions she originally possessed. Ethelbert was
succeeded by his son Edbald, who at once threw off
Christianity, an example which was followed by his
people. St. Lawrence, however, re-converted him, and by
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 37 -->
way of penance ordered him to re-build Christian churches
which had been allowed to fall into ruin, amongst others
that within Dover Castle.


It was probably during this period of repentance that he
allowed Ethelburga, daughter of Ethelbert, to marry
Edwin, the King of Northumbria. At first he refused,
saying that a Christian maiden was not allowed to be given
in marriatre to a heathen, lest the faith and sacraments of
the Heavenly King should be profaned by commerce with
a King who was wholly unacquainted with the worship of
the true God. But upon Edwin's promise that she and
her attendants should be allowed to practice their
religion unmolested, she was sent, and with her went
Paulinus, one of the original companions of Augustine,
ordained bishop by Archbishop Justus.


This was in 625. In the following year Edwin allowed
his own daughter to be baptised, together with eleven of
her household. Thenceforth Paulinus worked incessantly
at the conversion of Northumbria, and in 627 King
Edwin himself was christened at York, his example being
followed by thousands of his people.


Thus, as Dean Stanley says, from Canterbury the first
Christian City, from Kent the first English Christian
Kingdom, has by degrees arisen the whole constitution of
Church and State in England which now binds together
the whole British Empire.


But in 633, Penda of Mercia, and Cadwalla of North
Wales, both heathens, revolted against Edwin, and defeated
and slew him at the battle of Hatfield—either near
Doncaster or on the Severn. This ruined Christianity in
Northumbria; Paulinus and Ethelburga fled back to
Kent. Here, says the Comte de Montalembert, " She
obtained from her brother the gift of an ancient Roman
villa situated between Canterbury and the sea, on the side
which looks towards France (at Lyniinge). There she
founded a monastery, herself took the veil * * * *
The ancient church of her monastery still exists where is
shown the site of the tomb of her who passed here the last
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 38 -->
fourteen years of her life, and who as the daughter of the
founder of Canterbury, and widow of the founder of York,
constitutes the first link between the two great homes of
Catholic life among the Anglo-Saxons." AVe may
supplement Dean Stanley's remarks with an extract from
the little book edited by Canon Mason for the occasion of
the thirteenth centenary of the landing of St. Augustine.


\"The history of the Church of England begins with
Augustine and centres round his See of Canterbury.
Probably much more was effected by the Church of
Canterbury during the first seventy years than is evident
upon the face of the records. Its influence must have
been felt even where its claims were not recognised.
People passed through Canterbury on their way to and
from the Continent. Princes of other English Kingdoms,
like Redwald, visited the Kentish Court, and carried away
with them more or less of its Christianity As Ethelburga
had taken Christianity into the heathen realm of
Northumbria, so her daughter Eanfled took the Kentish
form of it back to Northumbria when she went to be
married to Aidan's disciple Oswy, attended by her Kentish
presbyter Romanus. ***** Christians from Kent kept
coming into the North, and Christians from the North
went to learn in those schools of Canterbury which were
the model schools of England."'


The history of Britain from this time for more than a
century is made up of a series of supremacies during
which hitherto independent Kingdoms were swallowed up
in the dominion of a supreme power. Kent was, on the
whole, less affected by these convulsions than any other
part of England, but this immunity, it must be admitted,
was owing far more to her inaccessible position behind
forests and marshes than to the greatness of her Princes
or the martial prowess of her sons.


For instance, when in 625 Edwin of Northumbria united
the whole of England under his sway, Kent alone remained
independent, but there was a marriage tie between the
Royal houses of Kent and Northumbria which may
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 39 -->
account for this. Again, there were the supremacies of
Oswald of Northumbria, of Penda of Mercia, and of Oswin
of Bernicia (the East of North Britain from the Tyne to
the Firth of Forth), and during these Governments Kent
seems to have been alternately in a state of independence
and submission, but generally retaining her own sovereigns.


Thus in 688 Cadwalla of AVessex, ambitious of spreading
his dominion along the entire Southern Coast, attacked
Kent, but was repulsed, whilst his successor Ine in 694
overran Kent, and thus extended the AVest Saxon
supremacy from Dorsetshire to Essex, including London.


It was just at this time of turmoil, in 690, that
Archbishop Theodore, who in 669 had come from Rome to
organise the Northumbrian, AVessex and Mercian
bishoprics—the first Archbishop, says Bede, whom the whole
church consented to obey—founded the famous school at
Canterbury for the teaching of religion, classics, sciences
and arts, whence radiated the first written English
literature, and of which Aldhelm was the most
distinguished alumnus.


To follow the fortunes of the Kingdom of Kent in
detail during the last century of its existence would be
a monotonous and profitless task.


Shuttlecock-wise it seems to have been tossed from
AVessex to Mercia, and from Mercia back to AVessex; we
hear of a fierce three years revolt of the Kent men
against Offa which in 775 ended in their defeat at the
battle of Otford; of another revolt in 823 which proved
the end of things, for Egbert of AVessex and his son
Ethelwulf finally put an end to the Kingdom of Kent
by the dethronement of its King Baldred, after an
existence of three hundred and sixty-eight years.


So now the three peoples which through all these long
years had been flying at each others' throats—the Jutes,
the Angles, and the Saxons, became, when Egbert
conquered Northumberland, one nation, for, although
Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia continued to
elect their own rulers, all paid tribute to Egbert and
acknowledged his supremacy.
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 40 -->

The last years of Egbert's reign were marked by the
appearance in Kent of a fiercer foe than had yet come
from over the seas. The so-called Danes, really
Scandinavians from Norway and Sweden, first landed in Sheppey
and committed terrible depredations in 832.


In 837 Egbert died, and Kent with the other South
{empty}.Saxon counties came under the rule of Athelstan, his son,
who fought the Danes at Sandwich in 851, but without
success, as they burned Canterbury and London, and
wintered in Thanet—an ominous proceeding which seemed
to indicate an intended residence in England.


In 854 Canterbury was again burned, and the story of
invasion and slaughter continues without a break until in
the j7ear 871 when Alfred, grandson of Athelstan,
ascended the throne of all England, which—an important
saving clause—was not subject to the Danes. He at once
set himself to his life's task of combating the Danes, who
were certainly masters of East Anglia, and almost as
certainly had firm footings in the South and AVest, and
it is pleasing to be able to record with tolerable
certainty the fact that in Kent some of the deeds which
have established him as one of the historic darlings of
the English people were performed.


In 885 the Danes besieged Rochester, which is believed
to have been relieved by7 Alfred.


In 893 the Danish chieftain Hasting sailed from
Boulogne with 250 ships, came to the mouth of the
Limen at New Romney, sailed up to Appledore by the
Rhee AA'all (see Note D at end of Chapter), burned it, and
carried fire and sword through all the country round as far
as Great Chart. At the same time another fleet had
landed an army at Milton near Sittingbourne, and the two
held our hapless county entirely at their mere}7.


At a battle in 903 near Bury St. Edmunds between
Edward the Elder, Alfred's son, and a son of Alfred's
elder brother Ethelbert, Ethelward by name, who had
made an alliance with the Danes, a critical moment arose
in the fortunes of the King when a retreat was ordered.
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 41 -->
All obayed but the Kent men. These stood their ground,
and as both Ethelward and the Danish King were slain
we may suppose that victory rested with our county men.


From now until the end of the century the story of
Kent is the same sad relation of a harried, ravaged county.
Sandwich " Omnium Anglorum portuuiu famosissimus,"
was the usual landing place; East and AVest Kent
suffered alike, and opposite policies such as that which
ordained the wholesale massacre of the Danes on St.
Brice's Day 1002, and that of buying off the foemen,
resulted in the same way—the vengeance or the
faithlessness of the pirates, and the gradual extension of the
Danish rule throughout England.


In 1011 Canterbury stoutly7 held out against the foe, but
treachery was at work within. Elfmer, Abbot of St.
Augustine's, admitted the besiegers, the cathedral and a
great part of the city were burned, and the Archbishop,
afterwards canonised as St. Alphege, murdered at a
brutal feast held within the precincts of the royal palace,
or, as other accounts have it, dragged on board the
Danish ships, kept in captivity for seven months, and
murdered at Greenwich.


The end was not far off. The terror of the Danish name
was such that a single Danish warrior sufficed to put to
flight half-a-dozen Saxons; Sweyn, King of Denmark
landed, Ethelred the Unready, with his family fled to
Normandy, and England passed under the Danish
dominion. This was in 1013.


Sweyn, however, died soon after his accession to the
sovereignty of England; the Danes in England appointed
Canute his son to be his successor, but the Saxon AA'itan
resolved to recall Ethelred from Normandy.


In 1015 Canute endeavoured to land at Sandwich, but
appears to have been driven off, and took his fleet
westward. Ethelred also came over from Normandy, but
desertion and dissension raged amongst those to whom he
looked most for support, and he died in 1016.  
  
  
  Edmund Ironside, Ethelred's eldest son, was the
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 42 -->
suecessor chosen by the bulk of the people, but the nobles
and the clergy were in favour of Canute. Each was
crowned king—Canute at Southampton, Edmund in
London, and the civil strife broke out anew.


Canute besieged London but was forced to withdraw;
at Otford in 1016 Edmund defeated the Danes. (See Note E
at end of Chapter,) but treachery withheld from him a
chance of sweeping Canute and his army out of existence,
and a defeat near Saffron Walden in Essex at what is
variously called Assandun, Ashlingdon, and Assingdon,
proved fatal to his cause, and shortly afterwards he was
assassinated, and Canute became King of England.
Under Canute there was a lull in the wearisome work of
war and pillage, but in Kent a figure was rising who was
destined to leave a deep mark on the county history.
This was Godwin Earl of Kent and Sussex. It was he
who assisted Edward the Confessor to the crown of
England in 1042, probably having had a hand in clearing
the other Atheling Alfred out of the way, and three
years later married his daughter to the King.


In 1048 a fleet of Norwegian pirates appeared off
Sandwich, and the town was plundered and burned, but they
were repulsed in an attack on Thanet chiefly by the
ecclesiastics of Minster Abbey7.


In 1051 an incident occurred at Dover wliich, although
unimportant in itself, was fraught with serious
consequences, and moreover exemplified the deep hatred of
foreigners which had been burnt and hacked into the
bosoms of the men of Kent. Eustace Count of Boulogne,
who had married the sister of Edward the Confessor, the
Countess Godgifa, had been paying a visit at the English
court, accompanied by a large armed retinue. That his
visit had been purely one of international courtesy may be
very much questioned when we see how AVilliam of
Normandy7 was at this time strengthening himself at
home, when we note how Norman influence was slowly but
surely asserting itself in England, how the three chief
bishoprics and many minor posts were held by Normans,
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 43 -->
and how in particular the Archbishop of Canterbury had
selected Earl Godwin, the recognised representative of at
any rate the national feeling of South England, as an
object of hatred.


At any rate the men of Dover, who shared with their
fellows of the other Kent Ports the distinction of being
able to value any foreigner at his real worth, resented
practically the overbearing behaviour of Eustace's Normans
with the result that the Normans were chased out of the
town with the loss of many men. Eustace complained to
the King; the King instructed Earl Godwin to punish the
town; the Earl refused to obey, and in lieu presented a
list of grievances borne by his countrymen at the hands
of the insolent foreigners who were beginning to
monopolise the chief offices of Church and State.


The King would pay no attention to the complaints,
and at the instigation of the Archbishop of Canterbury
the charge of having murdered Alfred Atheling was again
brought up against Godwin, and his offer to clear himself
on oath was refused. At the General National Assembly
held at Gloucester Godwin appeared with his sons and
men all armed, and demanded that Eustace and his men
should be surrendered to him. The request was of course
refused, and Godwin was ordered to quit the kingdom
within five days, whilst, to accentuate his wrath, the King
actually sent away his own wife, Godwin's daughter.
This was in 1052. In 1053 Godwin returned from
banishment with his sons, was enthusiatically received by the
men of Kent and Sussex, secured the fleet of what were
afterwards known as the Cinque Ports, went to London
and simply terrified the poor weak King into receiving
him actually with distinction, upon which his chief
Norman enemies made off as best they could He was
restored to his honours and possessions, his daughter
the Queen, was recalled from the nunnery of AVherwell,
the Archbishop of Canterbury was outlawed, and
Frenchmen in high positions made room for Englishmen.  
  
  
  It was during Earl Godwin's banishment that AVilliam,
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 44 -->
Duke of Normandy, made his first visit to England
and possibly it was whilst on this visit that he won
from Edward that strange promise that he should
succeed to the English throne, which he extorted from him,
or cajoled out of Harold at a later date. Godwin died
soon after his restoration to honour, and his son Harold
succeeded to the Earldom, whilst another son Tostig
became Earl of Northumberland by the death of the
Siward who had fought with the Macbeth ofShakespeare.


It was probably in 1064 that Harold was the hero of
that mysterious incident of the oath taken to William
of Normandy, which was to mark the future course
of our national history. AA'hat the oath was, and under
what circumstances it was taken, authorities are not
agreed, but that Harold did place himself under some
tremendous obligation to AA'illiam, the non-fulfilment of
which led to the Norman Conquest of England, is very
certain. Edward the Confessor died in 1066, and on the
next day Harold, son of Godwin, was crowned King
of England, not, be it noted, by the Archbishop of
Canterbury.  
  
  
  REAIARKS ON SAXON KENT.


Before we survey the relics of the Saxon dominion in
Kent which have come down to us, we will concisely
examine the form of Government.


The office of King was partly hereditary and partly
elective :—Hereditary7 so far as there was always a Royal
Family—a family from which the sovereigns were chosen;
elective in that the AVitenagemot selected the individual.


Next in rank came the Ealdormen, probably appointed
by the King. AA'hen the Kingdom of Kent as an
independency came to an end its sovereigns retained their
positions as viceroys under the conquering monarch
under the name of Ealdormen or Earls. In the
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 45 -->
independent Kingdom of Kent the Ealdorman was merely a
dignity. There were three—East Kent, AVest Kent and
Romney Marsh.


Below the Ealdormen came the Geres as who may be
described as the fiscal and administrative officers of the
Crown. These were :—  
  
  
  1.—The High Reeve: An official who went from place

to place on special duties.  
  
  
  2.—The Shire Reeve : Head of the Shire; formerly

head of the County Court, but as the King

gained power his was diminished, and he became

the principal political officer, chief of the
free
men, had charge of the county defences, held

the folk-mote, and controlled the mints.  
  
  
  3.—The King's Reeve : Who attended to the King's

personal affairs.  
  
  
  4.—The Burgh Reeve: A royal officer in charge of

the burghs.  
  
  
  5.—The Port Reeve: Controller of commercial affairs.

"Port" formerly meant much the same as

market.  
  
  
  6.—The Wie Reeve: The village officer.  
  
  
  7.—The Tung Reeve : An estate officer, a steward  
  
  
  8.—The Swan Reeve : Controlled herdsmen, foresters

and pastures.


After the Reeves ranked the Thanes, of whom there
were two, or perhaps three, classes; tenants in
Francalmoigne, who held lands bestowed on people devoted to
religious service; soldiers; soc men, described by Morgan
as "commended men of great lords," chiefly in Romney
Marsh and the AVeald border; labourers and villeins who
were personally free men, but unable to alienate lands
without their lords' permission, and paying rent by
services as well as in money; and, lastly, the Bordarii,
free men, but poorer than villeins.  
  
  
  These comprised the freemen of the county.


Slavery in Kent existed as generally and as strongly
as in any other county7, but the lot of the slave in Kent
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 46 -->
was probably better than elsewhere on account of the
free character of Kentish tenures. Slaves were of various
kinds—by conquest, by marriage, as in the case of a free
man marrying a slave-born woman he descended to her
estate, by parental decision, and by birth,


There was a large slave trade in Saxon England of
which London was the principal mart. Under Alfred
the condition of the slave was much ameliorated, one of
his laws being that a Christian could only be sold for
six years, after which time he or she was free.


The proportion of slaves in Kent has been calculated
at about one-tenth of the population, which at the time
of Domesday Book was about 13,000, but it is difficult
to make an exact estimate on account of the ambiguity
of the word servus.


The position of men was measured by7 the amount of
weregild to be paid for them in cases of murder or injury
by the offenders. Thus the weregild of an Ealdorman
exceeded that of a ceorl or yeoman three times. We
may7 here note that a Kentish shilling was worth more
than five times as much as a shilling in AVessex or Mercia.


The General Council of the Realm was the Witenagemot,
a non-elective body, summoned by royal writ and con
sisting of the King, the princes of the blood, the great
ecclesiastics, ealdormen, thanes, and soldiers. It met
usually at Easter and Christmas; it considered all public
acts before they received the Royal sanction, considered
new laws, made peace, war, and alliances, elected and
deposed the King, appointed, with the King, prelates, and
generally controlled ecclesiastical matters, levied taxes,
raised forces, and was the Supreme Court of Justice both
in civil and criminal cases.


Kentish Witans were held at Faversham, Bapchild,
Bearsted, Canterbury and Aylesford.


Shire or Folk Motes were held three times a year, always
in the open air. Penenden Heath near Maidstone has
been from time immemorial the great Kentish "atherinc
place, but all over the county place-names such as The
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 47 -->
Mote, the Shire Oak, the Shire Stone commemorate the
sites of these ancient assembly7 spots, just as the
"Gathering Stones" of the North Country mark the
ancient clan and tribal meeting places of that district.


Court Leets were held once in every three weeks in each
Hundred in the open air for criminal matters, and at these
all residents were bound to attend. Court Barons were
manorial assemblies at which the free tenants were obliged
to be present. As for the ancient Court of Dens, peculiar
to the AA'eald of Kent, we can best refer readers to Mr.
Furley7's exhaustive remarks upon it, and his confutation
of Mr. Kemble's theory that it was an outcome of the old
Mark system, in the volumes on the AA'eald of Kent to
which we owe so much in this present work.  
  
  
  The County of Kent was divided as follows :—

{empty}1.—Into East and AA'est Kent, and possibly into a  
  
  
  third part—Romney Marsh. Although this was
nominally an ecclesiastical division, for somecen  
turies it remained practically a political division.  
  
  2.—Laths : as peculiar to Kent as were Rapes or Ropes  
  
  
  to Sussex, Ridings to Yorkshire, and Parts or
Trithings to Lincolnshire. The word is said to
be derived from gelathean, to gather together.
There were seven Laths in Kent :—Canterbury,
Eastry, Limen (afterwards Shepway), AA'ye,  
  
  
  Milton, Sutton-at-Hone and Aylesford. (See
Note F at end of Chapter).  
  
  
  3.—The Laths were divided into Hundreds, it is
con
jectured, in the time of Alfred. In Domesday

there are 63 Kentish Hundreds; at present there

are 73. AA'hat a Hundred consisted of is not

known, whether families, or persons, or hides of

land, or villages.  
  
  
  4.—The Hundreds were divided into Boroughs or

Townships, consisting each of ten freemen or

heads of families who were sureties for each

other's good behaviour. The Borough head men

were known as Borsholders. (See Note G at end

of Chapter).
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 48 -->

Parishes, it is not generally known, were originally
distinctly ecclesiastical divisions, and were not, as has
been often asserted, co-extensive with manors.


\"In Kent," says Mr. Furley, " the sites of our
AngloSaxon churches formed the nucleus of our present
parochial system," and, say7s another writer, " were
circuits of ground committed to the charge of those who
had the cure of souls therein."


To show how extremely conservative Kent has always
remained in the matter of ancient rights and customs, it
may be cited with regard to tenures that whilst on
the Surrey Border the tenure of Borough English by
which real property descends to the youngest son is
general, AA'esterham is the only parish in Kent where it
prevails. Again, in the manors of Bayham and Frant,
each of which is situated half in Kent and half in Sussex)
Gavelkind (inheritance equally* to all sons) prevails in the
Kentish half, and primogeniture in the Sussex.


As briefly as is permissible let us review the remains of
the old life in our county during the period between the
departure of the Romans and the Norman Conquest,
which are still visible.

(I)—The Churches.


If it was only because the Anglo-Saxons built their
churches generally of wood it is not surprising that so
few specimens of their ecclesiastical architecture have
been spared until our times. Indeed, the only specimens
extant are mere fragments scattered here and there, such
as the clerestory arches in the church of Minster in
Sheppey, bits in walls such as those in the crypt of
Canterbury Cathedral, in the churches of St. Pancras and St.
Martin, Canterbury, in the latter of which the font and a
door are also Saxon, windows at Lyminge, and perhaps the
nave of Orpington.


The chief religious foundations of this period, generally
Benedictine, were Christ Church and St. Augustine's,
Canterbury, between 598 and 605 a.d.; St. Martin's,
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 49 -->
Dover, by Eadbald, son of Ethelbert, in 620; Folkestone
Nunnery, also by Eadbald, in 630 : Lyminge in 633 by
Ethelburga, the daughter of Ethelbert; Reculver in 669;
Minster in Sheppey, 670; Minster in Thanet by
Sexburga, Queen of Ercombert, King of Kent, in 675.


The clergy occupied a high position during this period.
A high weregild was paid for them; the oath of a priest
or deacon was worth more than that of a free man; they
acted as lawyers in property transfers, but were bound
like seculars by the services of tenures.

(II)—Castles.


Although under King AVidred Dover Castle was much
strengthened, no traces of Saxon work are extant, except
perhaps the outline of the defences of the ancient burgh.
Of Saxon Rochester there are few (if any) traces.
Allington, Canterbury and Chilham are on Saxon sites.

(Ill)—Cemeteries.


The Anglo-Saxon relics unearthed from the cemeteries
of Kent are unequalled elsewhere in England both for
quality as well as quantity. Almost every year brings us
news of a fresli discovery, and, although the finest
collection has left the county, enough remains to confirm the
words of Mr. Wright:


\"The Kentish graves, abounding in ornaments of gold
and silver and other jewellery, and containing many
articles indicating social refinement, show a people who
were rich and powerful, far more so than the other
AngloSaxon States where the precious metals are rarely found,
and the gold ornaments are replaced by gilt bronze; and
this explains to us the high position held by Kent
towards the other States at the dawn of our Anglo-Saxon
history."


The great superiority of the workmanship and of the
designs of these Kentish relics over relics of the same
character discovered elsewhere is thought to have been due to
Roman influence, but we decline to assent to this. The
chief Saxon and Romano-Saxon Cemeteries—for Roman  
  
  
  E
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 50 -->
skeletons are often found alongside Saxon—are at Bifrons
near Patrixbourne, Ozengall in Thanet, Bourne Park,
Sarre, Sittingbourne, Gilton Town and Ash near
Sandwich, Wingham, Breachdown, Eynesford, Lullingstone,
King-stone, Sibertswold, Milton, Cliff, King's Mead,
Faversham, along the hills on each side of the Medway Valley,
and perhaps along the AVye Downs. This is by no means
a comprehensive list, but is sufficient to show how widely
distributed is this antiquarian wealth.


The most interesting articles are weapons, the metal
parts of shields, armour, and horse furniture, knives, a
few axes, fibidee or brooches of extraordinary
variety—circular (characteristic of Kent) or cross-shaped, of gold, of
filigree work, set with stones or enamelled, of bronze and
brass and bronze gilt—rings of silver, bronze, bronze gilt
and brass, ear-rings, arm-rings of gold, bead necklaces,
spoons, crystal balls, vases, cups, urns, draughtsmen, keys,
bead bracelets, chatelaines, hairpins, combs, scales and
weights, and iron instruments of many kinds, glass
drinking cups, gilt-bronze bowls, buckets, and, of course,
Roman and Saxon coins. In Kent cremation does not
seem to have been frequent. The bodies were buried in
full dress, surrounded by the articles most associated with
the lives of the dead, and these articles are so invariably
placed according to rule that experienced excavators can
tell exactly from the discovery of one how* the others will
lie. Occasionally the discovery of bones in the mound
above the grave shows that the very general custom of
killing slaves or prisoners at funerals was practised by the
Anglo-Saxons. As a rule Anglo-Saxon barrows are on
hill tops, and in Kent at any rate are rarely solitary.


Our Kentish place names are naturally strongly7 Saxon.
Most of the names into which the syllable ing enters
commemorate the settlement of tribes, families, or, as
Mr. Kemble calls divisions of land held in common by
several households or several men, of marks, and in Kent
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 51 -->
these are very numerous. But they are hardly interesting
etymologies when compared with some others around us.
For instance, our sense of the ancient individuality, so to
speak, or even importance of some present-day obscure
village is not heightened much by the knowledge that it
was the settling place of the Syllingas, or the Bilsingas, or
the Semesingas; but when we connect it with mythology
and the worship of deities of whom nothing else is left but
the names of the days of the week, when we associate
Eastry with Eostre, the Saxon Aurora, and
AA'oodnesborough with AVoden, or Welling with the Scandinavian
Vulcan, AA'ayland, or Thurnham with Thor, or Godmersham
with Godmer, the British giant slain by Canutus, one of
the companions of Brutus—as we have as much right to
do as to associate them with other things just as misty and
uncertain—they become invested with a special interest.
At any rate, invaluable aid has been afforded to our
Kentish diggers and delvers in the mine of the Past by
names which at first sight suggest nothing.


Of Kentish industries during the Saxon period that of
corn growing was the first, despite the constant
interruptions from invasion and war. Indeed it has been
computed that as great an acreage was under cultivation
in Kent in Saxon times as there was at the commencement
of George III.'s reign.


There were extensive salt works near the coast—at
Rochester, Canterbury, Lympne, Milton, and Faversham.
There were vineyards at Leeds, Hailing, Chart Sutton,
Teynham, and other places. AVool was already a staple
commodity, and Canterbury was its chief market.

The mystery of the bones in Hythe crypt will probably never be
satisfactorily cleared up. This is a summary of expert opinion :—  
  
  
  (1) Only 10 out of 7*23 skulls examined show signs of injuries

inflicted before death.  
  
  
  E 2
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 52 -->

(2) The greater part of the skulls belong to Celtic and English
races; two seem to be Roman; two to be Lap or Danish.

(3) Skulls and bones belong chiefly to men in the prime of life;
three belong to children, and one to a person who had
not cut his wisdom teeth.

(4) Previously to being buried, if they have been buried at
all, the remains had evidently lain a long time in the
open air.

(5) No record exists of the placing of the remains here, but it
is almost certain they must have been stacked here since
the Reformation.

Dr. Randall Davis, of Hythe).

Augustine and his followers, according to Bede, landed at
Richborough, and waited there until it pleased the King to see them.
He says :—

"Which thing the King hearing came shortly after into the isle
of Thanet unto his pallace or castle of Rupichester, situate nigh
the old city of Stonehore, and the King sitting under the cliff or
rock whereon the Castle is built commanded Augustine and his
followers to be brought before him."

Ethelbert was baptised, after some hesitation, on the Feast of
Pentecost, 597, perhaps in the church of St. Martin or St. Pancras.
Bede says:

"St. Augustine and his followers in this church (Saint Pancras)
first began to meet, to sing, to pray, to say mass, to preach, to
baptize, till the King, being converted to the faith, allowed them to
preach openly and rebuild and repair all churches in all places,
when he believed and was baptised."

Ethelbert was baptised perhaps by Bertha's chaplain, Bishop
Liudhard, or by Augustine himself.
{empty}C.
Mr. Kemble says :

\"It is probable that from the very earliest times Kent had at
least two Kings, whose capitals were respectively Canterbury- and
Rochester, the seats of two bishoprics. The distinction of East
aud West Kentings is preserved till the very downfall of the Saxon
monarchy: not only do we know that Edric and Lothere reigned
together, but also that Widred and his son Ethelbeit the Second
did so Sigred deliberately calls himself King of
half Kent."

The record says "Sailed from Lympne to Appledore." The
Rhee Wall would hinder a direct passage, so we must suppose that

It is interesting to note a possible association between the Lathes
of Kent and the Three Lothians of Scotland. This district was
settled by Jutes soon after the middle of the fifth century, under
the traditional leadership of Octa, son of Horsa, and his brother
Ebusa. Less than two centuries later we find another association
between the two distant Kingdoms of Kent and Northumberland
in the marriage of Ethelburga of Kent with Edwin of
Northumberland, and the consequent conversion of the latter Kingdom to
Christianity.

a fine, but sadly dilapidated and degenerated old house near
Charing which is still known as the Borough of Sand Pett.

  IV.—NORMAN KENT.

@N September 28th, 1066, AVilliam Duke of Normandy
landed his army of invasion on the Sussex Coast
near Pevensey, but the first blood in this
momentous enterprise was drawn by the Kent men, for
William, in order to make a diversion, ordered a
detachment of his fleet to disembark troops at Romney,
and the Romney men repulsed it with great loss.


At the Battle of Hastings the Kent men were placed
in the van and throughout the day7 bore the brunt of the
fighting. Whether, as we Kent people like to believe,
this occupation of the place of honour was in satisfaction
of a historic claim of the Kent men to strike the first
blow in battle, or whether, as some modern dissectors
declare, it was merely in accordance with a general rule of
the times that the fittest people to be entrusted with the
key to a position were the natives of the neighbourhood,
we are not going to attempt to decide.


It is sufficient for us that the Kent men occupied the
position of honour on the field of Senlac, and that right
heroically they held it.


AVilliam's first steps after his victory were to establish
his base and march on London before the scattered
English could recover themselves. He marched Eastward,
inflicted condign punishment on the town of Romney for
having dared to oppose him, summoned Dover wliich at
once submitted and had to put up with the excesses of
his soldiers for eight days, to Canterbury which followed
Dover's example, and so on to London.
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 55 -->

It was during this march from the Coast to London
that the famous Swanscombe AA'ood episode is said to have
taken place. Briefly it was this. Swanscombe is between
Gravesend and Dartford, and here the Conqueror and his
men were confronted by the appearance of a vast
movingwood. As he halted, amazed and affrighted, so says the
legend, the wood resolved itself into an army in battle
array. From the ranks stepped forth Stigand, Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Abbot of St Augustine's, and
these demanded the recognition of the ancient Danish
Gavelkind system of tenure as had existed heretofore
and a partial restitution of territory7, with the alternative
of being attacked.


AVilliam, it is said, at once yielded to force majeure, and
from this circumstance arose the proud county motto, the
firm belief that Kent alone of all England defied the
Conqueror and retained her rights, and innumerable
ballads and sayings glorifying Kent in general and
Swanscombe in particular.


We are not of those whose delight it is to shatter the
darling creeds of the people, to shred the heroism or
romance or beauty off every attackable legend simj-ily7
because it is ancient and improbable, or to tear the
pleasing garment which Time weaves around facts as well
as buildings and expose its nakedness with the grim glee
of an anatomical operator. But we confess to absolute
scepticism about the Swanscombe affair, because in the
first place AVilliam had done and was doing his work
far too thoroughly to allow the possibility of the
existence of an army sufficient to crush him; and in
the second place AVilliam was not the man to be
frightened by a trick which he must have known was
a favourite one with Danish warriors, and was far ahead
of his age, as he oft showed, in his contempt for
superstition. Still, the story is widely believed, and has
the support of Mr. Jas. R. Scott, F.S.A., who tells us
that Swanscombe is Sweyn's Camp, and that the chief
mover in the business was Sweyn Godvinson, grandson
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 56 -->
of the great Earl Godwin, whose father was Sweyn the
Outlaw, cousin of the "young Siward " who had moved
Birnam to Dunsinane against Macbeth thirteen years
previously.


At any rate, the legend became so deeply rooted in
the Kentish mind, that, according to Drayton, three
hundred and fifty years later Erpingham's Kentish
bowmen at Agincourt bore as the device on their banner
an armoured arm coming out of a wood, above the
motto " Unconquered." To London AVilliam proceeded
without opposition, except for a gallant sally of the
Londoners, which was repulsed. Kent submitted without
a blow, not because the spirit of Kent was wanting,
but because AVilliam at Hastings had destroyed what
was practically the whole fighting force of the South
Eastern Counties, hence the litter emptiness of such boasts
as that Kent demanded and won from the Conqueror
independence. No unbiassed county man can read his
history thoroughly7 without being ashamed of the
Chauvinism which prompts such utterances.  
  
  
  Our greatest historian of this period says


\"William did not abolish the old Kentish laws, but
that is because he did not do so anywhere else; nor is
there anything to show that he treated Kent better or
worse than the rest of the Kingdom."  
  
  
  And again :


\"The little legislation of AA'illiam's reign takes
throughout the shape of additions. Nothing old is
repealed; a few new enactments are set up by the side of
the old ones."


AA'e may be sure that if any other county had special
customs and laws of its own, such as the Gavelkind
tenure of Kent—wliich, by the way, was by no means
limited in observance to the County of Kent—(see Note
A at end of Chapter) AVilliam, in pursuance of his glove and
gauntlet policy, respected them. As for the difficulty
raised in solving the question, why did AVilliam treat East
and AVest Kent so differently, disinheriting all the
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 57 -->
Manorholders of two AVest Kent Laths, and allowing those of
the four East Kent Laths to remain as in the days of
Edward the Confessor?—It may be answered that he no
doubt acted to people according to their deserts. East
Kent let him alone and he let it alone. If the
Swanscombe affair is to be accepted as a historical fact it would
seem that, inasmuch as Swanscombe is in West Kent,
AVilliam so far from being terrified into submission by the
apparition, punished the district for its presumption.


At any rate, the broad fact remains that Kent was not
only7 just as thoroughly subjected as any other part of the
Kingdom, but that during its subsequent history under
William's rule no such heroic episode is recorded as the
magnificent defiance hurled at the whole might of the
Norman crown by Hereward the AVake and his men in the
fens of East Anglia.


It is interesting to note that the first act of reward
made by AVilliam was the endowment of the new Abbey of
Battle with the Royal Manor of AVye, near Ashford,
with its lordship over twenty-two hundreds, and privileges
extending to Folkestone, Chart, and Milton. His next
act was to make Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, Earl of Kent
and Custos of the Southern ports, whilst Hugh de
Montfort was made Governor of Dover Castle. These
two officials abused their power so brutally that in 1067
the Kent men assembled at their ancient folk-mote
meeting place, Penenden Heath, and considered what
should be done.


They decided upon the worst possible course, and
invited Eustace, Count of Boulogne, the same who had
been so roughly received at Dover, and who only hated
the English less than he hated AVilliam, to help them.
Rochester Castle was attacked, but the patriots were
defeated, and the one effort made by the men of Kent to
kick against the authority7 imposed on them failed.


One of the first recorded trials in our history took place
in Kent in 1072. Archbishop Lanfranc complained that
Odo of Bayeux, as Earl of Kent, had appropriated lands
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 58 -->
belonging to the see, whereupon William called a meeting
of Kent men, not of Normans, on Penenden Heath to
decide the issue, and, when the meeting gave judgment
against Odo, William endorsed it and ordered it to pass as
law—a significant act when it is remembered who and
what Odo was.


By this trial Lanfranc won back Reculver, Sandwich,
Maidstone, Lyminge, Saltwood, Newenden, Preston,
Sandhurst, Erith, Orpington, Hayes, and Eynesford,
besides other manors. He devoted to religious uses the
ecclesiastical wealth thus regained, and particularly
embellished Canterbury Cathedral and St. Alban's Abbey.


Bits of Lanfranc's work at Canterbury still exist. In
the nave is his plinth in the North and South walls, with
blocks of Caen stone, not in situ. The same in the
AVestern Transepts. In the Cloisters' Eastern wall, a
doorway near its North End, and above that doorway,
three windows of the old Dormitory (now the Library)
are ascribed to Lanfranc. (Scott Robertson)


Until we reach the reign of Stephen there is nothing
noteworthy in the history of Kent, except the rebellion of
the barons, headed by Odo, against AVilliam Rufus, during
which Rochester Castle underwent a memorable siege.


Kent however comes to the fore in the turbulent times
of the last Norman Monarch. Briefly, the cause of the
ceaseless war of this reign was the succession to the
crown. Henry the First, contrary to the idea of the age
wliich regarded a monarch as necessarily a soldier, wished
that his daughter Maud should succeed him to the crown
of England, and relied upon his nephew Stephen to see
that his wish was carried out.


Stephen however had his own designs, and, directly
Henry was dead, declared on oath that Maud had been
disinherited by her father, and that he had been named
heir. Landing in Kent, he was refused admission to
Dover, but went on to London, and by the help of his
brother the Bishop of AVinchester, seized the late King's
treasure there, and with the support of the barons, who
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 59 -->
saw a chance of being more independent under a prince
with no firmness of character and a bad title than they
had been under the first three Norman Kings, was
crowned with his high-spirited wife Matilda at
Winchester.


Maud, however, was not going to be cheated of her
rights in this flagrant manner without a struggle. She
invaded Normandy7 and was repulsed, but she had
powerful allies over the water in her Uncle David of Scotland,
and her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester. The former
invaded England but was crushingly defeated at the battle
of Northallerton or the Standard in 1138. To the latter
Stephen made overtures against Maud, but although he
had taken the usual baronial conditional oath he
foresaw danger, fled to Normandy, and renounced his
homage.


Stephen then quarrelled with the Bishops of Salisbuiy,
Lincoln and Ely, destroyed their castles and seized their
property, whereupon Henry of AVinchester and the
clergy deserted his cause, and in this extremity London
and Kent alone stood up for him. Maud and Robert of
Gloucester came over to England with mercenary troops,
and everything went against Stephen; he lost Dover and
Leeds Castles, and finally was defeated and taken prisoner
at the battle of Lincoln, 1141.


Maud, who treated the captive monarch with great
indignity, was declared Queen at AVinchester, and crowned
by Stephen's brother, Henry, Bishop of AA'inchester.


Matilda set nobly to work to aid her imprisoned
husband. London and Kent loved her just as they hated the
arrogant Maud, whom they regarded as the representative
of the Norman party. AVith her young son Eustace, and
under the protection of AVilliam d'Ypres, Earl of Kent,
she went into Kent, whence, after assembling an army,
she marched on London where was her rival, Maud.
Maud, who was fast alienating her supporters, fled to
Oxford, closely pursued by the army of Londoners and
Kent men, and thence to AVinchester, which was
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 60 -->
immediately besieged. With great difficulty she escaped from
Winchester, but in covering her flight the Earl of
Gloucester, Maud's half brother, was captured. As a contrast to
the manner in which Maud had treated Stephen after the
battle of Lincoln, Matilda behaved to her captive in the
most kindly and generous way, and removed him to
Rochester Castle.


After much haggling and disputing, however, an
exchange of prisoners was effected, Matilda was re-united
to Stephen, and the Earl of Gloucester went to
Normandy to get aid for the renewal of the war. This was in
1141.


Stephen at once marched to Oxford, where was Maud,
and with his army of Londoners and Kent men so nearly
captured her that she only escaped by dressing herself
in white, and during a snow storm getting away on foot
to Abingdon, six miles away, whence they rode to
Wallingford. Here she met the Earl of Gloucester with
reinforcements from Normandy, and her son Prince Henry—
afterwards Henry the Second.


The tide of fortune turned for a while against Stephen,
who was defeated in 1143 at the battle of Wareham, but
the death of the Earl of Gloucester deprived Maud of her
chief support, and she herself retired to Normandy in
1145.


But this did not prove to be quite the end of the
struggle. War threatened to be continued by the rising
royal generations in the persons of Stephen's son
Eustace and Maud's son Henry.


The latter landed at Dover, whence, after rebuilding the
keep of the Castle, he advanced through Kent to
Wallingford on the Thames. Here he met Eustace. A battle
seemed imminent, but according to Matthew Paris, a
romantic appeal on the part of Maud brought about the
settlement of a peace by which it was arranged that
Stephen should remain King during his life, and that
Henry should succeed him.


As Maud was in Normandy at the time it is not
very clear what hand she could have had in the matter.
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 61 -->

Eustace was so disgusted at this arrangement that he
refused to agree, took himself and army off to Bury St.
Edmunds, burning and destroying as he went, and soon
after died " by the favour of God." This was 1152. The
next year matters were finally settled, Henry swore
fealty, and the barons allegiance to both, but the air
was full of treachery and uncertainty. A plot of
Stephen's son William and the Flemings against Henry
being frustrated by an accident to William on Barham
Downs drove Henry from the Kingdom, but in 1154
Stephen died. He was buried at Faversham in the
Abbey he had founded, where lay the ashes of his gallant,
faithful wife and of his son. A fine canopied tomb is
pointed out as their resting place, but the contents were
taken out and thrown into the Creek some four hundred
years later, for the sake of the coffin lead.  
  
  
  REMARKS ON NORMAN KENT.


The chief terror of the Norman period was caused by
the illimitable practise of building private castles, of which,
says Mr. Pearson, few, if any, existed before the time of
Edward the Confessor, when the Norman influence was
beginning to assert itself in England. The lord of a
private castle exercised life and death over all around
him, and if under the Conqueror he dared not actually
defy the sovereign, under Stephen his was an impeiium in
imperio, and he was practically an independent potentate.
Of the misery thus caused it is impossible to form any idea
at this distance of time, but we need not doubt that the
following description of England in Stephen's reign given
by the Saxon Chronicle applies as well to Kent as
elsewhere :


\"The nobles and bishops built castles and filled them
with devilish and wicked men and oppressed the people,
cruelly torturing men for their money. They imposed
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 62 -->
taxes upon towns, and when they had exhausted them of
everything, set them on fire. You might travel a day
and not find one man living in a town, nor any land in
cultivation. Never did the country suffer greater evils."


Of these castles we have still many substantial remains,
but it should be borne in mind that the following list by
no means represents the extent of the evil in our county,
inasmuch as it was one of Henry the Second's first tasks to
destroy the private castles erected under his predecessors,
so that the very sites of many of these strongholds have
yet to be discovered.


Dover and Canterbury were Royal castles. Best known
amongst the private castles are Rochester, Leeds,
Saltwood, Folkestone, Chilham, Tunbridge and perhaps
Allington and Eynesford.


At the Conquest there seem to have existed as
flourishing independent communities only five religious houses—
Christ Church and St. Augustine's (Canterbury),
Rochester. St. Martin's Dover, and Lewisham, which, by the way,
was an alien priory, belonging to Ghent. Ten other large
foundations had either been destroyed, or had been
absorbed as Lyminge and Reculver were absorbed by
Christ Church. But during the Norman period religious
house founding went on apace, and by the end of Stephen's
reign we find the Abbeys of Boxley, West Mailing,
Faversham, and Minster in Thanet, Higham Nunnery, of
which Stephen's daughter Mary was the first prioress, and
the Priories of Leeds, Folkestone, Dover, Lesnes, and
Davington. Minster in Sheppey Nunnery, which had
been destroyed by the Danes, or at any rate had been
abandoned, was re-constituted in 1130.


The best specimens of Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical
architecture in Kent are the West Front, the Nave (except
the last two east bays) and the Crypt of Rochester; at
Canterbury part of the choir, the plinths of the North and
South walls, the whole of the Great Crypt, the outer walls
of the choir aisles, the eastern transepts, the chapels of St.
Andrew and St. Anselm, the Treasury, the Transept
<!-- Leaf 91 -->
  
  
[['ANTERQUI.Y
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P91_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 63 -->
towers and many bits about the Cloisters, the Infirmary
ruins and the monastic buildings.


The best purely Norman churches are at Barfriston,
St. Margaret at Cliffe and Patrixbourne, and a long list
can be made of churches which present features of Norman
work, such as towers, doors, pillars and windows.


Although it may be deemed extraneous to a strict and
literal History of Kent, a short sketch of what the
Feudal System under our Norman Kings was is here
appended.


It must be premised that the Normans who conquered
England did not bring the Feudal System as afterwards
perfected with them. It followed upon the publication of
Domesday Book, when at Sarum the principal landowners
came forward and offered to become feudal vassals in 1086.
Amongst the Anglo-Saxons there was little of the spirit
of feudalism, and none of its after-elaboration. In the
spirit it existed in Normandy, and with the spirit
existed to some extent the tenures. But the perfection of
the system is due to William and his successors.  
  
  
  There were four kinds of service :

{empty}1.—Free : to serve in the wars, etc.

{empty}2.—Base : to plough, dig, etc.

{empty}3.—Certain : to pay a stated annual rate, etc.

{empty}4.—Uncertain : to wind a horn upon invasion by  
  
  
  Scots, etc. (See Note B at end of Chapter).
Land was of two kinds :  
  
  
  Allodial Land was that in which a man had full

and entire property.  
  
  
  Feuded Land was that which a man held of another,

in return for the performance of one or other of

the three following tenures.  
  
  
  1.—Knight Service. 2.—Free Socage.
{empty}3.—Copy
hold.  
  
  
  Knight Service contained the following " incidents : "

(a).—Aids, for which the lord might call if he wished  
  
  
  to marry his eldest daughter, to ransom himself  
  
  
  if taken prisoner, or to make his eldest son a
knight.
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 64 -->
  
  (b).—Reliefs, due from all on inheriting land.
(c).—Fines for Alienation, or if tenant died without  
  
  
  heir, lord took lands.  
  
  
  (d).—Escheat and Forfeiture, as by being attainted for

treason.  
  
  
  (e).—Primer Seisin, the King received of heir when a

tenant in chief died a certain proportion of the

year's profit, except when land was held in

Gavelkind, when no wardship could be claimed

by lord.  
  
  
  (f).— Wardship, custody of body and lands of heir

until of age.  
  
  
  (g).—Marriage, the lord had the right of nominating

a wife to his male ward, or a husband to his

female.  
  
  
  Escuage or Scutage, pecuniary payment in lieu of

military service. The abuse of this helped to

wreck the Feudal System, for military service

often becoming irksome or distasteful men escaped

it by this payment.

Free Socage (now Freehold)  
  
  
  Was a tenure by any certain service not being  
  
  
  knight service. It comprised the following
varieties :  
  
  
  1.—Burgage, when the king was lord of an ancient

borough in which tenements were held by a rent

certain. There was very little Burgage Tenure

in Kent.  
  
  
  2.—Borough English, by which the youngest son

succeeds.  
  
  
  3.—Gavelkind, by which the lands descend to all

sons alike, are not alienated for attainder for

felony, and the tenant may alienate his estate

at the age of fifteen. (See Note C at end of

Chapter).

Copylt old:  
  
  
  Villeins under indulgent lords gradually gained lands

which they enjoyed for a long time, and so were
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 65 -->
  
  inviolable, although their tenants could only show
a roll.  
  
  
  Other tenures were Ileriots, by which on the death of

a tenant the lord received the best beast on the

land, and  
  
  
  Francahnoign, whereby a religious corporation held

lands of a donor for ever with no burden but

that of the  
  
  
  2,rinoda Necessitas, i.e., repairing highways, building

bridges and repelling invasion.

Generally7, the results of the Norman Conquest were :—

{empty}1.—Separation of Civil from Ecclesiastical Courts  
  
  
  brought about by William's avarice, by his
anxiety to get rid of those who understood
Saxon law, so as to ensure the supremacy of  
  
  
  
Norman, and by his friendship with the Pope.
{empty}2.—Forest Laws established—hence our Game Laws.
{empty}3.—Diminution of the influence of County Courts and  
  
  
  institution of the Aula Regis, the proceedings
whereof were in Norman French.  
  
  
  4.—Introduction of Trial by Combat.
{empty}5.—Institution of Feudal Tenures.

  B.


Grand Serjeant}* was one of these uncertain services. The
following are some Kentish examples.


The Manor of Shorne was held by the service of carrying a
white banner for forty days when the King marched into Scotland.
That of Seale by blowing a horn at the approach of the enemy.
That of Bekesbourne by finding one ship for the King when he
crossed the seas, and paying three marks. The manors of
Copeland and Atterton in the parish of River, near Dover, were held
by the extraordinary tenure of supporting the King's head
whenever bad weather occurred during his passage between Dover
and " Whitsand" (Wissant). This was observed until the end of
the 16th century. The manor of Seaton in Boughton Aluph was
held by providing a man to lead the King's greyhounds whenever
he went to Gascon}*, until the leader had worn out a pair of shoes
worth fourpence bought at the King's cost. Certain tenants held
lands of the Archbishop of Canterbury by Grand Serjeant}*. Thus
the Badlesmeres held Hothfield by attending the Archbishop at
his enthronisation with water to wash his hands, the basin and
ewer being the tenant's perquisites, and also by being Chamberlain
to his Grace the same night, the bed being the tenant's perquisite.
The manor of Horton and the estate of Chartons near
Farninghanwere held respectively by the services of acting as cup-bearer and
chief carver at the enthronisation banquet.


Bilsington Inferior was held by the service of carrying the last
dish of the second course to the King's table at the Coronation
banquet, and presenting him with three maple cups. Bilsington
Superior, by serving the King with his cup on Whit Sunday.


Grange in Gillingham was held by the finding of a ship and two
armed men for the Cinque Ports fleet.


The manor of Ashton was held by guarding and carrying the
King's falcons.


Instances of Petty Serjeant}*, whieh primarily consisted in the
offering of anything pertaining to war, are found in the case of
Eastbridge, wliich was held by one sparrow-hawk; of two Boxley
manors held by finding a horse of a certain value, and one wallet,
and one skin of wine whenever the King marched to Wales; of
Wilmington in Boughton Aluph, by the presentation of a meat
hook to the King whenever he should come into the manor; of
Oxenhoath, Lullingstone, St. Mary Cray and others by the
presentation of one pair of gilt spurs annually; of Footscray,
which was held by Walter Abell in the fourteenth century, by the
providing of one "sure sparrow-hawk."

  V.-PLANTAGENET KENT.  
  
  
  Part I.—The Reigns of Henry II., Richard I.,
John, and Henry III.  
  
  
  a. Henry II. 1154-1189.

interest of Kentish history under the first
<y I © Plantagenet King, Henry the Second, grandson of
Henry the First, is concentrated upon the quarrel

between the King and Thomas a Becket.


The key of the quarrel was the question as to whether
the Church was to enjoy its ancient privileges—privileges
which encroached sorel}' upon the royal power—or not.
The Kent men stood up for Becket throughout, and this
despite the fact that one of the new King's first acts was
to humble the power of the great barons, until now the
most dreaded and implacable enemies of the people, by
razing their castles to the ground. We have seen that the
Norman Churchmen in high office could play the parts of
oppressors and tyrants as effectively as did the lay barons,
but this was because the churchmen, rewarded by the
Conqueror with temporal power, were de facto ecclesiastics
in little else but name. Abbots and Bishops owned
castles and led armies, and their ecclesiastical titles and
garb were but cloaks to enable them to enrich themselves.
At the same time there was a bond between churchmen
and people which did not exist between baron and people.
If the abbot or bishop wrought mighty wrong, the
institutions with which they were connected were the only
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 69 -->
fountains of charity and help at which the poor, the
oppressed, the sick could quaff freely, and in an age when
superstition and ignorance went hand in hand to an
extent hard to be realised nowadays it may readily be

imagined that the bulk of the people, with the choice of
two evils, preferred the lesser.  
  
  
  But there was more than this in the sturdy partisanship

of the Kent men for Becket. There was firstly, his
endearing personality, which differed wondrously from the
personality of such men as Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and
the stoled and mitred tyrants of the first two Norman
Kings. Finally, there was growing up in Kent a yearning
for the personal freedom which, the Kent men learned as
their commercial intercourse with the Continent grew
closer, was being won by their own class in Flanders and
France, and this personal freedom seemed more likely to
be theirs under the Church than under a King who was
palpably bent upon crushing Church, Baronage and
People into one plastic mass to be moulded or shredded

at will.  
  
  
  In her little book on this reign Mrs. Green says:—"The  
  
  
  men of Kent were stout defenders of their customary

rights; they clung tenaciously to their special privileges—
(whatever these may have been ! ) they had their own

views of inheritance, their fixed standard of fines

they were a very mixed population, constantly recruited
from the neighbouring coasts. They held the outposts of
the country as the advanced guard formally charged with
the defence of its shores from foreign invasion, which was  
  
  
  a very present terror in those days... And it seems

as though the shire very early took up the part it was to
play again and again in mediæval history, and even later,

as the assertor and defender of popular privileges."

Thomas a Becket was personally known and personally

beloved by the people of Kent. He had a singularly
gentle and winning manner, he was magnificent, and he
was an Englishman. When, after his elevation to the
Archbishopric of Canterbury—the first Englishman since
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 70 -->
the Conquest to fill that position—business took him from
place to place, he travelled magnificently and slowly,
magnificently as became the first subject in the land,
slowly because it was impossible to travel otherwise on
the Kentish roads of Henry the Second's time. He had
a splendid palace at Canterbury, and Castles or
manorhouses—palaces really, although not so called—at Ford,
Charing, Lyminge, Otford, Teynham, Gillingham, and
perhaps Saltwood.


Around Otford in particular memories of the great
Archbishop still cling. We may see the well called after
him, one of the obligatory places of halt for the pilgrims
along the sequestered old way to his shrine : we may
follow the path still called St. Thomas' Walk, and some
old villagers still pretend to believe that nightingales never
sing at Otford because they disturbed Thomas at his
devotions, and that no blacksmith can flourish at Otford
because one mis-shod the Archbishop's horse. (See Note A
at end of Chapter).


To understand aright the fatal quarrel between King
and Archbishop we must bear in mind that at this time
the Church had jurisdiction not only exclusively over the
clergy, but that it exercised wide powers over the laity,
and that, without doubt, under cover of this a great many
crimes passed unpunished, and what touched Henry far
more nearly, a vast amount of wealth which would
otherwise have gone into his coffers passed into ecclesiastical
treasuries.


This is a History of Kent, but the histories of a Becket
and the Kent of his day being inseparable, as brief as
possible a resume of the quarrel must be permitted. It
may be divided into five stages :  
  
  
  (1) Thomas resigned the Chancellorship with which  
  
  
  Henry had invested him in the hope that
Church and State would thus be brought
closer together, and declared that his life and
work were henceforth for the Church alone.  
  
  
  This much displeased the King.
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 71 -->
  
  (2) Thomas refused on ecclesiastical grounds to allow  
  
  
  Henry to marry his brother to Stephen's  
  
  
  daughter-in-law.  
  
  
  (3) Thomas refused to consent to the King's plan of  
  
  
  appropriating local revenues in the shape of  
  
  
  land tax for his own use.  
  
  
  (4) Thomas pressed the recovery of Tunbridge,  
  
  
  Rochester, Hythe and Saltwood Castles as  
  
  
  belonging to the See of Canterbury.  
  
  
  (■-)) The important one : Henry pressed the principle  
  
  
  that ecclesiastics should be punished by the
Common Law for offences committed against  
  
  
  the Common Law.


During the course of our history we have often occasion
to note what prominent parts have been played in it
byplaces which are now insignificant : for instance, the
fighting of two important battles at Otford, and the
ancient importance of the town of Wye : (See Note B at
end of Chapter) and we may here record that one of the
first circumstances which fanned Henry's wrath into flame
on the question of ecclesiastical supremacy was the action
of Thomas in excommunicating a priest whom Henry,
through the patron of the living, William of Eynesford,
had appointed to the church at Eynesford.


That Thomas had not entirely thrown off the soldier
when he assumed the mitre, and that the old fighting blood
of his profession was not stagnant within him, was evident
by the promptitude with which he laid siege to Tunbridge
Castle, when the possessor declined to admit his claim to
it, as belonging to the See. Indeed, throughout his career
he was a dealer of buffets rather than a weaver of webs,
and it was this sturdy English spirit which played no
small part in his popularity, and no doubt doubly sanctified
him in the eyes of the simple folk when they learned that
to the last moments of his life, in the winter gloom of the
Cathedral transept, he stood defiant with uplifted cross
before his assassins whilst his terrified comrades ran for
their lives.
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 72 -->

In order to settle the great question of the interference
of the civil authorities with ecclesiastical offenders, Henry
summoned a Council at Winchester. In reply to the
King's command the bishops all said, "We will obey in
all things save our order." The King burst out into a
violent rage, before which the prelates quailed and backed
out of their sturdy position. Thomas alone remained firm,
until, at the prayers and entreaties of the bishops who
foresaw that opposition to the King spelt their ruin, he
yielded and declared that he would obey the customs of
the kingdom.


Instantly the King called a Council at Clarendon to
clinch matters. Then, Thomas, ashamed at having yielded,
took up his old position of defiance. The King raged, the
barons drew their swords, and for a moment it seemed as
if the tragedy in Canterbury Cathedral was about to be
anticipated.


Thomas yielded again, and declared himself ready to
obey the customs of the Kingdom.


"Let the customs of the Kingdom be written down !"
cried the delighted King.


The result was the Sixteen Articles known as the
Constitutions of Clarendon. This was in 1164.


As these Constitutions established exactly what Thomas
had been combating, and generally attacked the power of
the Church, Thomas refused to sign them, or, if he did
sign them, refused to get the Pope's sanction to them, and
threatened to appeal to Rome. The King's anger was so
terrific that Thomas attempted to escape to France from
Romnev*, whieh belonged to the Archbishopric, but failed.


His disgrace followed, and when he obeyed the royal
summons to attend the Council at Northampton marked
humiliations were heaped upon him. At this Council a
case came up against Thomas in which the great vexed
question of the competency of non-ecclesiastics to pass
judgment upon an ecclesiastic had to be settled. No
decision being arrived at the King broke up the Council
in anger. It is unnecessary to detail the bickerings, and
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 73 -->
disputes, and quarrels which followed. Suffice it to say
that at length Thomas contrived to escape to the Papal
Court at Sens.


During his absence the famous Assize of Clarendon was
passed,—a series of laws framed as a complete reform of
the system of administering justice, of which one of the
most important was a hard hit at the principle of
ecclesiastical Privilege of Order, as it laid down that no
privilege of order could harbour an offender against the
King's officers. This was in 1166.


Thomas was now made Papal Legate for England, and
at once exercised his power by excommunicating Henry's
chief agents. Henry retaliated by virtually deposing
Thomas from the Archbishopric, and by making it penal
for anybody to admit his supremacy. So the miserable
quarrel continued—Thomas fulminating excommunications
from Sens, Henry hurling back defiance.


At length, from political motives, Henry performed an
unheard of act—caused his boy son Henry to be crowned
by the Archbishop of York. This roused the Church
party, and Henry was probably convinced that he had
gone too far as he met Thomas in Normandy, and to all
appearance arranged amicably for his return to England in
full possession of his dignities.


Thomas, with a pathetic farewell to the Bishop of
Paris—" Vado in Angliam mori,"—returned, not because
be believed in the King's sincerity, but from a stern sense
of duty, and with a determination to do it, and at once
excommunicated all who had taken part in the late
coronation.


He landed at Sandwich and proceeded straight to
Canterbury. Lyttelton thus describes the journey : "On
the road thither he was met by all the poor of the country,
who in great multitudes attended him to the city. The
parish priests also came in solemn pomp to meet him with
their crosses in their hands, and the pageantry was closed
by the monks of Canterbury, who received him into their
convent with the ringing of bells, the music of organs, and
with hymns of praise to God."
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 74 -->

On Christmas Day, 1170, he preached in the Cathedra],
and publicly excommunicated Robert and Randolph de
Broc, who had been foremost in persecuting him. Henry
was in Normandy when all this news reached him, and,
bursting forth into one of his characteristic furies, he
uttered the historic words which sent four knights across
the sea to Hythe, to Saltwood Castle, where they arranged
their plan, and along the old Roman Stone Street to
Canterbury, where, on the night of December 29th, 1170,
they accomplished their master's vengeance.


All night " Becket's" body seems to have lain in the
transept still known as the Martyrdom, although retaining
scarcely any of its original features, but the next day the
monks, fearful of a threat uttered by Robert de Broc that
if the body was not removed it would be torn asunder and
cast into the dung pit, took it away secretly to the
remotest chapel East of the apse of Ernulf's crypt, but
again it was removed behind the chapel of Our Lad}7.


Miracles began to be performed at once, but for twelve
months the Cathedral remained silent, bereft of its
hangings, and desolate. Henry's remorse amounted almost
to loss of reason, and for weeks he shut himself up,
refused to see anybody, and passed his time in prayer and
penance.


On December 21st, 1171, the Cathedral was re-opened
for divine service, and pilgrimages from all parts, not only
of England, but of Europe, became the rage, and even
the erstwhile foes of Becket did penance. In 1174 the
King in person performed penance. He walked
barefooted from St. Dunstan's to the Cathedral, and placing
his hand in one of the apertures of the tomb, which was
still in the crypt, he was flagellated, and passed the night
there.


He repeated the penance next year with his son, again
in 1178, and again in 1181.


With the death of Thomas a Becket we may close our
survey of Kent during this reign. The county seems to
have been free from disturbing influences, and, from the
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 75 -->
number of charters granted to towns during the next
hundred years, we may suppose that it was not only
slowly and surely regaining its old unique industrial
character, but extending its foreign trade. Sandwich,
Dover, Hythe, and Romney were its principal ports,
although Fordwich, then accessible for ships of burthen
from the sea, was a place of importance, and even at the
time of the Domesday survey possessed ten mills and
seven fisheries. The Weald too was gradually being
opened up, den place names began to be frequently
mentioned, but, as the earliest allusion to the Wealden iron
industry dates from the thirteenth century, we must
suppose that the Roman methods of extracting metal
from ore—so rough that the early Sussex workers often
found that it paid them better to treat the scoriæ of the
Roman furnaces than to dig out fresh ore—had been
forgotten, and that what at a later period made the
wealth of this country was left untouched.  
  
  
  b. Richard I. 1189-1199.


The reign of Richard the First, so far as Kent is
concerned, may be treated in a few words.


In 1189 the King held a great Council of the Realm at
Canterbury, at which William King of Scotland attended,
and Richard renounced sovereignty over that Kingdom.
After this the King started from Dover for the Crusades.
He returned after his captivity in Germany, in 1194, and
by way of thanksgiving for his escape walked from
Sandwich to Canterbury in penitential garb.  
  
  
  c. John. 1199-1216.


The bad King John—for even this whitewashing age
has been obliged to leave John as black as it found him—
had some important dealings with our county.


In 1201, in order to spite the Archbishop of Canterbury
by putting him to vast expense because the King con
ceived that he kept Christmas in a style more befitting a
monarch than a subject, he had himself crowned a
second time. In 1203 John kept Christmas in high state
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 76 -->
at Canterbury. He was frequently at Chilham Castle,
then a Royal manor, but with the Palace at Eltham,
called by his name, he had no more to do than had Julius
Cæsar, for the very sufficient reason that it was not built.

The death of Archbishop Hubert at the Teynham
Manor House in 1203 brought about the troubles of this
reign. Every election to the Archbishopric of Canterbury
was an occasion of bitter dispute between the Bishops
and the monks of Christ Church. Upon this occasion the
monks quietly elected their man and sent him off to Rome
to receive the Papal confirmation, and the Bishops, with
whom was the King, elected their man, John de Gray,
justiciary and bishop of Norwich.


Pope Innocent the Third, who resented the Royal and
Prelatical election as an act of tyranny on the part of the
Crown, when appealed to set both candidates aside and
insisted that Stephen Langton, an Englishman, should
occupy the high position. Such interference with the
rights both of the English Church and the English Crown
aroused the wrath of the nation, and John, for once
backed up by all parties, refused to elect Langton and
defied the Pope.


Thereupon the Pope placed the whole Kingdom under
an interdict—no mere harmless fulmination in those days,
—and for four years there was a suspension of all public
religious performances throughout the land. John then
threatened retaliation, whereupon the Pope first
excommunicated him and then published a crusade against King
and people, and selected Philip of France to lead it.


John's answer to this was to assemble an army of 60,000
men on Barham Downs, at the same time that the Cinque
Ports Fleet, ever faithful to John, sailed across the
Channel, met the French Fleet, fought it, and burned a
hundred ships. This naval battle in 1213 is believed to be
the first recorded in our annals in which manœuvring
under canvas was resorted to to any extent. Mr. Clark
Russell says that the battle afterwards fought by Hubert
de Burgh off Deal was the first thus signalised. At any
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 77 -->
rate, the development of our national navy may be fairly
considered to have been begun in this reign.


But the kingly spirit which had prompted some such
noble answer to the Pope's legate as that which
Shakespeare puts into the mouth of John, beginning :  
  
  
  " What earthy name to interrogatories

Can task the free breath of a sacred King ? "

was failing. John could place no reliance upon the huge
army on Barham Downs, composed largely as it was of
Welsh and Flemish mercenaries. He was fast alienating
the barons by his brutal and arbitrary behaviour. The
men of Kent were true to him, but the men of Kent were
but a fraction of the armed force of the Kingdom. He
was terrified at being alone in his defiance of the
tremendous power of the Holy See, backed as it was by the
armies of the ablest monarch in Christendom.


He had an interview with Stephen Langton—probably
at Chilham Castle, and upon the news that Pandulph, the
papal legate, was over the water, he invited him to
England.


The first meeting between King and Cardinal was held
in April, 1213, at Ewell, a grange belonging to the
Commandery of Knights Templars at Swingfield—a fact
still memorialised by the name Temple Ewell, which is
sometimes used, and that of the Temple Farm hard by,
whilst, according to Mr. Moore, a spot close to the latter
is called Jerusalem.


On May 25th, 1213, John had a second interview with
Pandulph; this time at the domus of the Knights
Templars on or near Bredenstone Hill, near Dover, the
result being that he laid his crown and sceptre at
Pandulph's feet, received them back as vassal of the Pope,
agreed to the installation of Stephen Langton as
Archbishop of Canterbury, and to pay 1,000 marks annually as
the rental of England and Ireland.


A roar of rage and shame burst forth from end to end
of England at the news of this dastardly act,—and yet,
like more than one other event whieh at the time seemed
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 78 -->
a national calamity, it proved in a double sense the
salvation of England.


The barons, backed for once by the people, except those
of Kent, fiercely denounced him. The first result of their
defection was the defeat of John by the French at
Bouvines in 1214, and the second was the granting of
the Great Charter.


If it is impossible to over-estimate the importance of the
latter, the value of the former is scarcely less remarkable.
\"It must be remembered that from 1066 the English were
ruled by an alien race, and that England was far more an
appanage of Normandy than was Normandy of England.
It seemed probable that the Norman Kings of England
would reduce the whole of France under their sway, and
establish an empire extending from the Scottish Border to
the Pyrenees. Had they done so England would never
have had a separate existence, but would have been a
province of France. She owes her escape from this
calamity to an event which some historians have
represented as a misfortune—the separation of England and
Normandy. Had John been like his predecessors and
Philip Augustus like his the Plantagenet dynasty would
have ruled the united Empire of England, Ireland, France,
and probably Scotland. But just at this conjuncture
France was ruled by a prince of great vigour and ability,
England by a trifler and a coward.


John was driven from Normandy, and the Norman
nobles, compelled to choose between England and the
Continent, shut up by the sea with those whom they had
hitherto oppressed and despised, came to regard England
as their country and Englishmen as their countrymen.
The two races, so long hostile, soon found that they had
common interests and common enemies; both were alike
aggrieved by the tyranny of a bad King; they began to
draw near to each other in friendship, and the first pledge
of their reconciliation was the Great Charter, extorted
from a tyrant by their common exertions, and framed for
their common benefit."
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 79 -->

We have quoted the above at length from Macaulay, as
bearing upon the history of our county, inasmuch as in
Kent was struck the blow which freed England from the
tryanny of a brutal and incapable King by alienating his
barons and his people. If John had continued to defy
the Pope there is little doubt that Philip Augustus would
have landed, have marched through the island, and have
tightened the bonds which made England an appanage of
Normandy.


It is interesting to note with reference to the Great
Charter that the copy familiar to all who have visited the
MSS. Room in the British Museum is that which Sir
Edward Dering gave to Sir Robert Cotton, and which had
been found in Dover Castle in 1630, whereto it'had been
taken by Hubert de Burgh, Chief Justiciar of England
and Governor of the Castle.


It is hardly necessary to say that John had not the
smallest intention of observing a Charter wrung from him
vim et armis. If he had lost the support of the barons and
of the majority of Englishmen by his action at Ewell, he
had gained the Pope, and the Cinque Ports Fleet was still
true to him. John applied to the Pope, who
excommunicated the barons and released John from his
obligations to them, which had no effect, and enlisted an
army of Flemish mercenaries which alarmed the barons
and set them on the war path. They seized Rochester
Castle, which was immediately besieged by John, but the
defence, despite the lack of assistance from London, the
baronial head-quarters, was gallant, and three months
elapsed ere starvation effected what arms had failed to do.


A miserable war between King and barons followed,
but as Kent was with the King she seems to have escaped
the desolation and misery which accompanied the
campaign in other counties. Fortune favoured John for
once, and the barons in despair invited Louis, eldest son
of the King of France, to be King of England, and in
1216 he set sail for England with 700 ships. Stormy
weather and the Cinque Ports fleet kept him in check for
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 80 -->
a while, but he at length landed at Stonar, took
Canterbury and Rochester, and then John, unaided by the
fuhninations of his ally, the pope, against Louis, lost the
support of the Kent men (except the garrison of Dover
Castle) who declared for Louis and the barons.


Louis went on to London, and although not actually
crowned, practically reigned as King of England.


Dover Castle, under the care of the gallant Hubert de
Burgh, still held out for John, as did the Cinque Ports
fleet, and Louis tried every means to reduce it, but
without success. Perhaps, without being accused of too
much county bias, we may agree with Lambarde that this
fidelity of the Kent men to John in no small degree
contributed to the maintenance of the position won by
England when she lost the battle of Bouvines—
independence of Normandy. At any rate the tide of luck
seemed to be turning in favour of John when he died,
1216.  
  
  
  d. Henry III. 1216-1272.


Although John had named his son Henry as his
successor, and the majority of the baronage supported
him, Louis the Dauphin had by no means abandoned the
quest on which he had come. He went to France for
reinforcements, but the Cinque Ports fleet instantly
prepared to prevent his return. He, however, contrived
to land at Stonar, burned Sandwich, and again attacked
Dover Castle and with no more success than before. In
the meanwhile other troops of his had been badly defeated
at Lincoln, and he was forced to ask for further
reinforcements from France. Eighty ships accordingly were
assembled at Calais under Eustace the Monk, and put
to sea with the intent of rounding the North
Foreland and proceeding to London. Hubert de Burgh heard
of this and appealed to the Cinque Ports, saying, " if
these people land England is lost; let us therefore
boldly meet them, for God is with us, and they are
excommunicate."  
  
  
  At Dover were sixteen large ships and some smaller.
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 81 -->
These the townsmen and fisherman got out, and Hubert
de Burgh's men at arms formed their crews. The little fleet
was manœuvred so as to get between the Frenchmen
and Calais; Eustace naturally imagined that the
English object was the plunder of Calais, and
laughed, for he had left that port well protected.
Hubert's real plan, however, was to secure the windward
position, in which he succeeded, came to close quarters,
with the result that the Frenchmen were massacred,
and that of their eighty ships only fifteen escaped.


Froissart thus describes a sea fight of the period :
"The bowmen and archers began the engagement
with a volley of arrows * as soon as their ships came in
contact they were fastened together with chains and
hooks; powder of lime was scattered in the air that it
might be carried by the wind into the eyes of the enemy,
and the English, leaping on board with axes in their
hands, rendered the ships unmanageable by cutting* away

the rigging."


This great victory is thus spoken of by Mr. Hannay :
\"The trial stroke of the English navy was a master
stroke. No more admirably planned, no more timely, no
more fruitful battle has ever been fought by Englishmen
on water. It settled for ever the question how best this
country is to be defended. In after times, during the
Armada year and later, there have been found men to
talk of trusting to land defences; but the sagacity of
Englishmen has taught them to rely on the Navy first,
and that protection has never wholly failed us in six
hundred and eighty years. The battle is
curiouslysimilar to the long list of conflicts with the French which
were to follow it. The enemy is found carrying out a
scheme of attack on our territory, and so intent upon his
ultimate object as to neglect to attack our ships first.
Hubert de Burgh, acting exactly as Hawke, Rodney,
Hood, or Nelson would have done, manœuvres for the
\"weather gage," the position to windward, falls upon the
Frenchman on his way, and wrecks his carefully laid
scheme at a blow."

<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 82 -->

It is a proud fact never to be lost sight of by a true
Kent man that the foundation of our magnificent naval
dominion, and hence of our colonial empire, was laid by
these gallant if somewhat unscrupulous thirteenth century
men of the Cinque Ports.


For two hundred years the Cinque Ports navy was
practically the Royal Navy of England, and the only
bulwark against foreign invasion; for a still longer period
the chief military ports of the Kingdom were those of
Kent; and almost to our own era the chief material for
the construction of our national " wooden walls" was
obtained from the forests of the Kent and Sussex Weald.
(See Appendix C^/?, The Cinque Forts).


After the naval victory mentioned above, Louis, having
obtained a loan from the City of London, returned to
France for good.


When William, Earl Mareschal, who had been
appointed Regent of the Kingdom, died in 1219, he was
succeeded by Hubert de Burgh, who now reached the apex
of his chequered career. Too much of a patriot to suit
the easily influenced young King, and accused by the
jealous barons of extortion and avarice, he found himself
attacked on all sides, and after an almost absolute rule of
more than eight years as Justiciar, Earl of Kent,
Constable of Dover Castle, Warden of the Cinque Ports,
Warden of the Welsh Marches, and lord over many
Castles, he was arrested, imprisoned, and finally released,
to die in obscurity in 1243.


We may note by the way how closely associated with
our county were the three men who stand out prominently
in these dark reigns of John and Henry III. as patriots
and champions of English freedom—Stephen Langton,
Hubert de Burgh, and Simon de Montfort.


\\\ 1220 the remains of St. Thomas a Becket, together
with some four hundred relics, prominent among which
was the arm of St. George, were " translated " with great
pomp from the new West Crypt to the magnificent shrine
in the Trinity chapel. There were present the King,
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 83 -->
Pandulph the Pope's legate, Archbishop Langton, the
Archbishop of Rheims, Hubert de Burgh, bishops, and
\"four great lordlings," and these carried the coffin and
set it in the shrine. Until the fourteenth century the
shrine stood alone in the Trinity chapel, but later it had
for neighbours the tombs of the Black Prince, Henry the
Fourth and his wife, and Archbishop Courtenay.


After the " translation" there was a sumptuous
entertainment at the Archbishop's palace; the Archbishop
supplied hay and oats for the horses of all who came from
London, and the conduits in Canterbury streets ran wine.


This year more than £20,000 was received in offerings
at the shrine.


Passing over several years, uneventful so far as the
County of Kent is concerned, but marked by misery and
disaffection amongst all classes, and an utter lawlessness,
we come to the year 1258, when the famous "Mad"
Parliament of Oxford was held. A sinister sign of the
times was that the barons who attended came fully armed
and accompanied by their retainers, by which show of
force they wrung from the King an oath to maintain the
statutes of the Great Charter, and, what was especially
significant as a proof that the process of cutting England
adrift from the Continent had been completed, that the
Castle of Dover and others, and the Cinque Ports should
henceforth only have Englishmen for Governors.


In addition to these, the principal of the Provisions of
Oxford, as they are called, were :  
  
  
  1.—Supply to depend upon redress of grievances.  
  
  
  2.—Four Knights to be chosen by each county to  
  
  
  point out the local grievances.  
  
  
  3.—Three sessions of Parliament to be held every  
  
  
  year.


But the King had no more intention of keeping these
Provisions than had his predecessor of keeping the Great
Gharter, and on the plea that his oath had been extorted
from him by force he got the Pope to abrogate it.  
  
  
  The barons flared up. Cn their side they had been  
  
  
 1 -2
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 84 -->
acting selfishly and foolishly in aiming at the
establishment of an aristocratic despotism, but that laws solemnly
made and ratified should be cast aside at the whim of an
unpatriotic King was too much. Simon de Montfort here
comes to the front; hitherto he had been regarded as a
scheming ambitious foreigner, but as Earl of Leicester,
and as being related to the King by his marriage with
Henry's sister, widow of the late Earl Mareschal, he was
powerful, and he was elected popular leader.


Henry prepared to assert his claims by arms, and the
barons acted correspondingly.


Before war actually broke out an attempt to settle the
dispute was made by referring it to the judgment of the
King of France, but as he decided entirely against the
barons, annulled the Provisions of Oxford, and gave all
the power back to the King which they had denied him,
the barons determined upon war.


De Montfort had been elected leader, but a strong
feeling amongst the barons that he had other aims than
those he professed to champion, drove him into exile, from
which he was recalled in 1262.


It is not to our purpose to detail the miserable condition
of war which came over the land on the top of a
miserable condition of peace. Kent and the Cinque Ports
stood by the barons; Rochester Castle, held for the King,
was unsuccessfully besieged, Tunbridge Castle was taken
by him, the land was abandoned to freelances aud outlaws,
and as the Royal Armies swept through Kent into
Sussex they perpetrated every excess, for, although the
people were universally against the King, he was in
possession of most of the strong places, except the Cinque
Ports.


In 1264 De Montfort and the barons utterly defeated
the Royal Army at Lewes; Henry was taken prisoner
and passed into the personal charge of De Montfort; his
sons Edward and Henry were held as hostages for the
observance of the Provisions of Oxford, and Earl Simon
held Court in almost regal state at Canterbury In
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 85 -->
December a Parliament was called which is for ever
remarkable as being the first genuinely popular national
assembly, the first occasion when burgher and trader,
baron, knight, and bishop, sat side by side. Whether
De Montfort's Parliament shewed us, as Mr. Green
thinks, " the large and prescient nature " of his designs, or
whether, as Mr. Hallam thinks, by summoning two
citizens from each borough and thus appealing to the
people rather than to the barons, he was endeavouring to
ingratiate himself with his own faction, mindful rather of
personal gain than of public weal, it is not easy to judge.
The writs are still extant by which each sheriff is directed
to return two lawful, good, and discreet Knights for his
shire.


Instantly at the news of Lewes, Eleanor the spirited
queen of Henry, the " noble virago" as Matthew of
Westminster calls her, spared neither trouble nor expense
in order to rescue him, and gathered together on the
opposite coast an enormous army. To meet the threatened
invasion De Montfort assembled by edict to every city,
town, and village, an army on Barham Downs, " so great
a multitude both of horse and foot united in one mass,
powerful for war against the foreigners, that you would
not have believed it to exist in England," but the Queen's
army was wind-bound and dispersed, and De Montfort's
levies did the same.


At length Prince Edward escaped from confinement;
many of the barons deserted De Montfort, partly because
they resented his too stern and literal sense of justice,
partly from sympathy with fallen royalty; the royal army
defeated the younger De Montfort at Kenilworth before
his father could reach him with reinforcements, and
marched on to meet the old Earl, who, with King Henry
in his train as a hostage, was hurrying from Wales.


At Evesham Simon de Montfort was amazed to see the
Royal Army with Prince Edward at its head, and saw
that he was entrapped, for the Avon forms a loop round
the town on three sides, whilst the fourth is blocked by a
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 86 -->
hill called the Green, down which poured the royal troops
cm the ominously dark morning of August 4th, 1265.
"By the arm of St. James, they come on well!"
exclaimed the old warrior, "but it was from me they
learned it! Let us commend our souls to God, for our
bodies are the foes !" What followed was more of a
butchery than a battle. " The murder of Evesham,"
Robert of Gloucester calls it. De Montfort, fighting
valiantly to the last, was killed, and his head carried on a
pole to Wigmore. Of his forces killed an old rhymer

says  
  
  
  " The number non wrote, for tell them mot no man,  
  
  
  Bot He that alle wrote, and alle thing ses and can."


Under the title of " Sir Simon the Righteous,"
De Montfort long reigned affectionately and reverently in
the memory of the people, and many healing miracles
were performed upon people afflicted who were encircled
with his " measure " or girdle. Mr. Furley gives a list of
twelve Kentish people thus cured.


De Montfort was described as " too great for a subject,
wliich had hee not beene, he must have been numbered
amongst the worthiest of his time."


There is a remarkable poem extant, written after the
Battle of Lewes, in which the barons give as their
motives for war the necessity of reform. A stanza
translated from the Latin runs :


\"May the Lord bless Simon de Montfort, and also his
sons and his army who, exposing themselves
magnanimously to death, fought valiantly, condoling the
lamentable lot of the English who, trodden under foot,
had languished under hard rulers, like the people of Israel
under Pharaoh, groaning under a tyrannical devastation."


So Henry was established on the throne : he kept the
Christmas of 1271 at Eltham, now a royal palace, and
died in 1272.  
  
  
  NOTES ON PART I.


The miserable condition of the people of England, which was
especially marked during thc turbulent reign of John, reached its
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 87 -->
climax in the reign of Henry III. The groans of the lower classes
were vented throughout these two reigns in passionate outbursts of
satirical poetry in which the vices and extravagance of the nobles,
the venality of the judges, and the alternate oppression from the
Wolves and the Foxes, as the Barons and the clergy were aptly
termed, were fearlessly scathed. Utter lawlessness prevailed
throughout our country districts. " Nobody," says Canon Jessopp,
speaking of Norfolk, aud we may probably apply the words to
Kent, "nobody seems to have resorted to the law to maintain a
right or to redress a wrong till every other method had been tried.
The law of the land was hideously cruel aud merciless, and the
gallows and pillory, never far from any man's door, were seldom
allowed to remain long out of use. The ghastly frequency of the
punishment by death tended to make people savage and
bloodthirsty. It tended also to make men absolutely reckless of
consequences when once their passions were roused."


And yet this was the century of the Great Charter, of the first
popular Parliament, and of the revival of religion !


The two remarkable revolutions in the reign of Henry III. are
the development of the English language, and the coming of the
Friars.


By the loss of Normandy under John the barons were compelled
to regard England as their home. Hence the gradual dying out of
the Anglo-Norman language in home life. It was still retained at
first as the tongue of the Court and the Law, but even at Court it
gradually gave way to Central French, a distinct language from
Norman French, and during the latter half of Henry III.'s reign
the Law Reports were in Latin, although the Royal Proclamation
of 1258 is in French and English. Although French was the
language of the upper classes, private documents were in Latin,
and in schools English was much used. Even in the reign of
Henry II. there is evidence of Normans of high birth being able
to speak English, and a Knight of that period was even obliged to
get a tutor to teach his son French.


Little by little French became the tongue of a very few, and the
exact equivalent of Chaucer's French of Stratford atte Bowe is
found in the thirteenth century expression "He speaks the French
of Marlborough."


So when Edward I. ascended the throne England was English
from top to bottom. Hitherto, under the reigns of Richard, John,
and Henry III. the body of the nation was English but the head
was alien; Edward was contemporaneously described as Edward
the Fourth of the English, and Edward the Third of the sovereigns
of Britain.


When the first Dominican Friars landed in England in 1*221 they
came to supply a long and sorely felt want. Hitherto the spiritual
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 88 -->
necessities of the people had been ministered to, when they were
ministered to, by the Monks. But the Monks never left their
buildings; it was no business of theirs to go abroad in the exercise
of their calling; their notion of duty was to follow the routine of
the monastery and not to be concerned with anything that went on
outside its stately walls unless it touched their purses or their
stomachs. If an ailing or starving wretch came to the monastery
gates they physicked or fed him, but it was no part of their work
to go out into the highways and ditches and find the halt, the
maimed, the blind, and the distressed, and such an act as a hut
bedside visitation would possibly have been considered derogatory
to the dignity of the order, and as unbecoming the performer's
gentle birth.


After the interdict placed on the Kingdom during John's reign,
when for eight years the practice of religion was actually
suspended throughout the land, the Monks relapsed into a
condition of indolent Sybaritism, so that the condition of the
people, especially in the awful slums of the thirteenth century
towns, was one of utter heathendom.


The Dominicans (Preachers or Black Friars) came in 1221; in
1224 the Franciscans (Friars Minor or Grey Friars) followed, and
these little bands of noble, devoted men spread themselves abroad
over the face of the dark, faithless, uncared for country, treading
literally in the footsteps of the Apostles in that they took no
money in their purses, no food in their scrips, and were bound to
live and sleep unsheltered, to do the great work of moving the
hitherto untouched hearts of the scum of the population in the
truest spirit of their names—Mendicants. (See Xote C at end of
Plantagenet Kent.)


We may note here that it was in Canterbury that the Franciscan
vanguard of nine men were first received and encouraged and made
their mark. Simon Langton, the primate's brother, befriended
them, so did Sir Henry de Sandwich and Lady Inclusa de Baginton
(Birchington ?), and from Canterbury they went to London and to
the Universities. With their later degeneracy we have nothing to
do, but the movement was notable if only for the principle it
accepted, that the religious strength of a nation should be looked
for in its masses, and not as hitherto confined to its classes.


The reign of Henry the Third affords another instance of benefit
accruing from apparent calamity. If England had not been
conquered by William, if Normandy had not been lost by John, if
a strong prince like the first Edward had succeeded John, our
insularity, the very secret of our national prosperity and glory,
would have been a fact of much later time if it had ever become
a fact at all. Briefly the salient points of the reign were :  
  
  
  1.—Normans and English became united.
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 89 -->
  
  2.—A strong hankering manifest after the laws of Edward the  
  
  
  Confessor.  
  
  
  3.—Growth of the spirit of representation.  
  
  
  4.—In 12.38 the first instance of supply being made to depend  
  
  
  upon redress of grievances.  
  
  
  5.—The struggles of the barons to establish a check on royal  
  
  
  authority produced Parliament.


And still, it is hard to believe with Hallam that " from the
reign of Henry III. at least, the legal equality of all ranks of
freemen below the peerage was to every essential purpose as
complete as at present," although we know that slavery was
declining. Still the improvement in the condition of the slaves
was due rather to their development of powers of combination
than to concessions made them by masters and laws.


A notable characteristic of the reign of Henry III., and one
which had no small share in fomenting discontent among the
miserable masses of the people, was the spread of luxury amongst
the governing classes. The King set the example, for he was an
outrageous dandy. " The most sumptuous and splendid garments
ever seen in England," says Miss Strickland, "were worn at the
Coronation of the young queen of Henry III." On this occasion
the King himself was arrayed in a tissue of gold. From the
Court the rage spread to the nobles. Such was the excess to
which table gluttony was carried that a sumptuary law was passed
that no more than two dishes were to be served at a meal. As the
old-fashioned castle became to be felt inconvenient and
uncomfortable as a dwelling place, the keeps were either much enlarged or
altogether relinquished as residences except in time of siege, whilst
more convenient apartments were erected in the entrance towers, a
new arrangement which may be observed in Tunbridge Castle.


Painted glass was probably first used in English churches during
this reign, perhaps at the building of the Lady Chapel of
Westminster Abbey. The famous old windows in Canterbury
Cathedral—the two in the North Aisle of the choir, in Trinity
Chapel, the centre window of Becket's Crown, and the great west
window, are believed to date from this period.


Glass windows even in the houses of the wealthy were not yet
dreamed of. Here may be noted by the way that the sciences of
glass window making and of building in brick seem to have utterly
died out with the departure of the Romans. There is no brick
domestic building extant in good repair older than the
reign of Henry VI., but Queen's College and Clare Hall,
Cambridge, and part of Eton College date from Edward IV. Even
in the reign of Elizabeth glass windows were such costly rarities
that noblemen carried them from place to place when they shifted
their residences.

Part II.—The Reigns of Edward I., IL, ILL, and
Richard II.  
  
  
  Edward I. 1272-1307.


If the History of England, according to Lord Macaulay,
properly begins with the reign of John, the history of
Englishmen in the strictest sense of the word begins with
Edward I. Later on we shall give instances of the growth
of the English language as evidence of this * at present,
speaking more generally, we see for the first time the
wearer of the English crown an Englishman by birth, by
appearance, and, above all, by character.


As Mr. Green says : " He is the first English King since
the Conquest who loves his people with a personal love,
and craves for their love back again, and it was this
distinction of character which earned him so fairly his
title of the English Justinian."


The early part of this reign was occupied with the
conquest of Wales, and Holinshed tells us that the Cinque
Ports fleet went to Anglesey, where " they bore themselves
right manfully."


Still, proud as we may be of the county's share in the
building up of the British Navy, we must not shut our
eyes to the fact that these Cinque Ports sea-dogs were sad
rascals, and that they as completely ruled the "narrow
seas " by piracy as did the West Country buccaneers of a
later date the Carribean and its approaches. In fact this
piracy was so rampant that the prices of foreign goods in
England were enhanced, and the Ports themselves were
little better than nests of chartered sea robbers. The
Cinque Ports ships were always fighting somebody : if not
a Frenchman or a Spaniard, then a Yarmouther, and one
of the last acts of Edward before he became King had
been to call a meeting of the Cinque Port barons at
Shepway to punish them for acts of piracy.
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 91 -->

In 1293 this piracy practice brought about a national
war, and exemplifies the extent to which private warfare
was carried. There was a row in a Norman or Gascon
port between English and French sailors, the result
being that a man was killed, and the Englishmen
chased to their ships. Soon after the Frenchmen
captured two out of six English ships, hung their crews
together with dogs, and paraded the Channel defying the
Englishmen. The four English ships which had escaped
reported the matter at Dover; Cinque Ports ships went
over to Normandy, raided the shores, and accepted a
challenge from the Frenchmen to fight the matter out
in mid channel. This resulted in the defeat of the
French and in declaration of war between the two
countries.


Two years later the French sent a fleet of two hundred
ships against England. Five galleys were detached to
reconnoitre off New Romney, and one of them landed men
at Hythe. The Kent men made a show of flight, but at
the right moment turned, slew two hundred and fifty of
the invaders, and burned their ship.


For this the French admiral landed at Dover and sacked
the town and priory, but the country people, who seem
always to have been in some sort of training for this kind
of work, assembled and drove the French back to their
ships with the loss of 800 men.


On the whole we have a right to believe that there was
not a livelier neighbourhood in all England at this period
than our Kentish coast, and we do not even except the
Borderland of England and Scotland.


Between the years 1280 and 1287 England was afflicted
by a series of disastrous inundations, storms, and frosts.
It was during the last year that the great change in
Romney Marsh, to wliich we alluded to in the chapter on
Early Kent, took place, by which the fate of Romney as a
port was sealed.


In 1293 fifty Kentish gentlemen accompanied Edward
to the siege of Caerlaverock in Scotland (said to be the
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 92 -->
original of the Castle of Ellangowan in Guy Mannering),
and were knighted for their services, which seem to have
consisted chiefly in jousting with each other and with
champion knights of the foe, for a regular sit-down siege,
such as was that of Caerlaverock, was something of a
picnic for the host outside the walls, however rough it may
sometimes have been for the people inside.


Although not a peculiarly Kentish matter, it is
impossible to pass over the reign of Edward I. without some
consideration of his claim to the title of " the English
Justinian."


In 1279 a severe blow was dealt the temporal power of
the clergy by the Statute of Mortmain, by which religious
bodies were forbidden to hold lands without royal
permission. Hitherto, land held by a Corporation—religious
or secular—not being capable of wardship or marriage,
paid nothing to the lord, was in fact held in mortud manu.
The monks by their influence over dying men contrived to
get an enormous amounty of property into their hands,
which contributed nothing to the military service of the
country. Moreover, Corporations rarely parted with their
lands, so that the business of transfer became quite
stagnant. But for this law it seemed likely that the
greater part of the land in the kingdom would become
church property.


In 1282 was passed the Statute of Merchants. This
enabled traders to recover debts by appropriating the
rents of a certain portion of debtors' lands.


As regards the County of Kent, Edward's mercantile
legislation was most important. The foreign trade was
developing by leaps and bounds. The development of
town life was equally remarkable. Trades' Guilds were
being formed everywhere. There was constant intercourse
with Flanders, especially Bruges, with Gascony, the
Rhineland, and Spain for wines; with Venice, Lombardy, the
Hanse Towns, and the Levant; the coal trade of the
North was becoming important; foreign merchants were
afforded every encouragement and protection, and the
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 93 -->
outcome of all this activity and enterprise was that the
merchants became a power in the land in that they shared
with the Lombards, who had replaced the expelled Jews,
the distinction of being the Royal bankers. This was the
age which produced Whittington, Canynge of Bristol, and
the De la Poles, afterwards Dukes of Suffolk. In fact,
although the Soldier still led Society, the Merchant, in an
age of which one of the chief characteristics was a general
feeling of revolt against clerical predominance in politics
and society, was edging out the ecclesiastic.


The Statute of Quia Emptores, 1290, was a retrogade
Act aimed at limiting the power of the new classes of
yeomen and squires who were springing up with the spread
of commerce, inasmuch as it obliged sub-tenants to hold
directly of the lord and not of a tenant. It restricted, in
fact, subinfeudation.


The Statute of De Donis enacted that land given to a
man and the heirs of his body should go to his issue in
regular succession so long as any existed, and on failure
of issue would revert to the donor. This established
entails, and was obtained by the nobility who wished to
perpetuate their possessions in their own families.


In the same year, 1285, was passed the Statute of
Winchester, by which public order and security were
secured by what was virtually a revival of the old system
of Frank pledge—districts being held responsible for
crimes committed within their limits; watch and ward
established in cities and towns, and highways ordered to
be cleared for a space of 200 feet on either side.


But the chief claim of Edward I. to be called the
English Justinian is based upon the following all-important
principles established in Parliament :—  
  
  
  1.—No tax to be levied without consent ofParliament.  
  
  
  2.—Taxation to be dependent upon redress of  
  
  
  grievances.  
  
  
  3.—« Aids " to be granted not by free tenants only,  
  
  
  but by all free men.  
  
  
  4.—Taxation and representation inseparable.
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 94 -->

And, by the Parliament of 1295, came a revival of the
principles of Le Montfort's famous Parliament :—  
  
  
  1.—Knights of the Shire admitted. Hitherto they  
  
  
  had been mere local deputies for taxationpurposes.  
  
  
  2.—Boroughs represented : a distinct gain for the  
  
  
  Crown, inasmuch as the burgesses as proper
representatives made grants far more readily and  
  
  
  
generously than they had yielded to exaction.
{empty}3.—Clergy represented. But they did not appreciate  
  
  
  it, held aloof at first from taking any part in
parliamentary proceedings, and finally kept away  
  
  
  altogether.


In 1287 was passed the Confirmatio Cartarum, by whieh
all private property was secured from royal spoliation, and
placed under the safeguard of the Great Council of the
Realm; and it was re-made law that no "aids" should be
levied without the consent of this Council.


It is needless to say that all and every one of these
wholesome and advanced provisions were broken in after
times, but the credit of their conception and carrying
through remains with these thirteenth century
Englishmen, and with the great King who in an age of Divine
Right of Kings fostered them and made them law.


In 1299 King Edward married his second wife, Margaret
of France, at Canterbury, in that part of the Cathedral
near the Martyrdom. Amongst his offerings at the shrine
during his numerous visits was the crown of Scotland
wliich had been found amongst the baggage of John
Balliol at the time of his banishment.


In the same year the King made a progress through
Kent, and the operation of the Statute of Winchester
seems to have been satisfactory, if the comparatively rapid
progress of the King be a criterion. Thus, he went from
Canterbury to Dover in one day, and from Dover to Wye
in one day. Thence he went on to Charing, Smarden,
Cranbrook, Sissinghurst, May-field, Wateringbury, Leeds,
and arrived at Canterbury on the twenty-fourth day.
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 95 -->

In the same year, during the war with Scotland, the
Cinque Ports Fleet engaged the enemy in the Solway,
captured 28 ships, and routed 16,000 men.


In 1302 the King made another journey through Kent,
going by New*enden, Ashford, Dover, and Canterbury, and
is said to have given away three pounds, modern value, in
charity each day.


In this year the Kentish clergy stood up against the
demand of the King for a half of their possessions so
that he might carry on the French war. The result was
that the Vicar of Tenterden and sixteen others were
arrested and imprisoned, undaunted by the fact that even
the Archbishop's horses had been seized by the King.


In 1305 Prince Edward was banished from Court for
some indiscretions in which he and his friend Piers
Gaveston were concerned, and spent much of his time at
Wye, Chartham, Canterbury, Ospringe, and
Sutton-atHone.


During this reign Eltham became a royal palace, for,
although Henry III. had spent the Christmas of 1270
there, it belonged to Beke, bishop of Durham, who, if he
did not build it, much enlarged and beautified it, and gave
it to Eleanor, Edward's queen.


Some of the finest English castles were built during this
reign, but in Kent the only two now existing of that date
seem to be Allington and Cooling.  
  
  
  Edward II. 1307-1327.


Edward stayed at Wye Manor House until the funeral
of his father, and, according to Lambarde, kept the
Christmas of 1307 there.


The first five years of the King's reign were spent in a
continual contest between King and nobility about Piers
Gaveston, the royal favourite, who was created Earl of
Cornwall and placed at the head of affairs. The barons,
now too English to view unmoved the honours heaped
wholesale upon a foreigner who had only the qualities of a
tournament Knight to recommend him, did not relax their
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 96 -->
efforts until Gaveston was exiled. But, upon Edward
yielding to the complaint of the Commons of England
about certain grievances, the favourite was recalled.


In 1307 there was one of those national outbursts
against particular sects or communities as characteristic
of modern as of old times, which resulted in the expulsion
from England of the Knights Templars. There is much
in common between this outburst against the Templars
and that of a later age against the Wandering Friars.
Both bodies were actuated at the commencement of their
careers by principles of the sincerest virtue : both were
bound by the strictest rules of abstinence and self-denial :
both went astray from the simple paths they had marked
out, became intoxicated with success, became wealthy,
worldly, powerful political bodies, and lost sight of their
original raison d'etre. Both fell with a mighty fall.


The chief accusation brought against the Templars was
that they had dealings with the supernatural world, and in
evidence the rector of Godmersham said that a Templar
had told him : " AVe have three vows, known only to
ourselves, God, and the Devil." Their master was
imprisoned at Canterbury, their houses put down, and
their estates forfeited. The localities where they settled
are still often recognisable by names such as St. John's
near Ash, Temple Manor near Dartford, Temple Ewell and
the neighbouring Temple Farm, St. John's Hole at
Rodmersham, Temple Stroud and perhaps Temple House
at Kennington.


In 1308 the King and his queen, Isabella of France,
were at Dover, and during the preparations fen* the
coronation resided at Eltham. The outrageous conduct of
Piers Gaveston now* brought about his ruin, he was
executed, and the King took this so much to heart that
he retired to Canterbury in sulky dudgeon. In 1312
Edward, afterwards King, was born, and in 1316 John of
Eltham, at which place he was baptised. The Twelfth
Night festival of this year was kept at Eltham with
unusual magnificence.
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 97 -->

In the meanwhile the Cinque Ports sailors were
distinguishing themselves in their usual high-handed
lawless fashion. They compelled foreigners to
acknowledge English supremacy in the "narrow seas," a very
flagrant instance of this being the case of a Fleming who
was wronged by English sailors—probably robbed and
thrashed—at a spot which was not within English
dominions but which was washed by " English Sea," which
acknowledged fact rendered his appeal to Edward as Lord
of the Sea fruitless. Another instance was that of the
Spanish ship Blessed Mary of Fuenterrabia, which was
driven ashore and plundered by men of Romney, Rye and
Winchelsea, and, when enquiry into the matter was ordered
to be made, the Cinque Ports people prevented it by force.
About this time the ship's rudder was invented : a second
mast with fighting tops was introduced, and the elevated
stern stage which afterwards became the poop.


The chief event of this reign connected with the
history of Kent was the rebellion of Lord Badlesmere.
After the death of Piers Gaveston the King took unto
himself another favourite in the person of Hugh le
Despenser, and his repetition of the old favouritism aroused
the resentment of the barons, who were under the
leadership of the Earl of Lancaster.


Badlesmere was a man in high office, being Warden
of the Cinque Ports, and Governor of Bristol, Chilham,
Tunbridge and Leeds Castles, which last he had got
by exchange from the King, it having belonged to
Edward I. as forming part of the dowry of his widow,
Queen Margaret.


Edward, with the idea of strengthening himself as
much as possible, wanted to have Leeds back. But
Badlesmere, hearing of this, threw a garrison into it,
and, leaving Lady Badlesmere under the charge of Sir
John Colepeper, who no doubt had his instructions,
proceeded to Canterbury, where he recruited men under
the standard of the baronage.  
  
  
  Edward sent his queen, Isabella, the " she wolf of  
  
  
  H
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 98 -->
France," under the pretext of a pilgrimage to
Canterbury, to ask a lodging at Leeds. Lady Badlesmere,
however, noting that the Queen was attended by a very
much more warlike following than was consistent with
a religious errand, refused her admittance, shots were
fired from the castle, and some of the royal retinue
slain.


The insulted Queen applied for redress to the King,
who at once marched on Leeds, and Lady Badlesmere
surrendered after showing fight for awhile.
Badlesmere was depending upon Lancaster, who had formed an
alliance with the Scots, but the King marched against
him, defeated him at Boroughbridge in 1322, took a
signal revenge by executing Lancaster, Badlesmere and
Colepeper and so crushed the rebellion.


The remainder of this reign is the continued record
of misery. Famine occasioned disturbances amongst the
peasantry, who were in constant revolt; the men of Kent
held several meetings on Penenden Heath upon the
subject of "aids" in payment of the knights of the
shire at the rate of four shillings per diem, an
imposition from which they considered the prevalent
tenure of Gavelkind absolved them, and so, when the
King was deposed and met his frightful death in
Berkley Castle, the nation had sunk to the lowest
estate.  
  
  
  Edward III. 1327-1377


Bannockburn rankled deeply in the proud English heart,
and the young King's first attention was to his unruly
neighbours over the Border. But, if the mind of the
people was bent upon avenging the defeat, the Kent men
at any rate were in no mood to submit to a partial levy
of contributions towards the war. And so in the very
first year of the reign the Prior of Christ Church,
Canterbury, was summoned to help the bailiffs and citizens
in sending twelve men-at-arms to Newcastle against Bruce.
He refused, pleading that lands held in francalmoigne
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 99 -->
were not liable to military burdens. The bailiffs and
citizens of Canterbury held a meeting and passed a series
of resolutions by which the monastery was practically
boycotted and outlawed, for they rightly held it shame
that the wearing of a tonsure should absolve a man from
contributing to the national defence. The monks were
locked in and threatened to be thrashed if they so much
as showed their noses, no supplies were allowed to be sent
in, and strangers were even forbidden to leave offerings at
the shrine of St. Thomas.


The matter was smoothed over, but is important as one
of the many evidences of the fast growing feeling against
clericalism. Another is the fact that whereas in the 13th
century no less than 296 new religious houses were built
in England, in the 14th the total was but 64.


War with France—the famous Hundred Years' war—
raged throughout this reign. Edward's claim to the
French throne was utterly untenable, for the three sons
of Philip le Bel had died without leaving male issue, but
had left daughters. Edward claimed through his mother,
a daughter of Philip, asserting that he as a male
grandchild stood nearer to the succession than the females,
although they were daughters of sons of Philip, and
although the Salic law had been set aside.


The first part of the war was glorious to our arms both
ashore and afloat.


In 1340 the English fleet gained a great victory over
the French under Philip of Valois, at Sluys. There are
three different accounts of the extent of the defeat, so we
give them all. Hume says that 240 English ships defeated
400 French with 40,000 men on board, taking 230 ships
and slaying 30,000 Frenchmen! Froissart places the
French fleet at 120 large ships with 40,000 men; whilst a
letter from Edward to his son speaks of 190 ships as the
French fleet, of wliich all but 24 were taken, and adds
that there were a great many English ladies on board
his fleet going to attend the Queen at Ghent.  
  
  
  In 1346 Edward collected a great fleet for the siege  
  
  
  h 2
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 100 -->
of Calais. Haklyt writes of " the roll of the huge
fleete of Edward III. before Calice," that it consisted of
1,738 ships and 15,000 sailors. To this the Cinque Ports
contributed 105 ships and 2,200 men, but already the
western ports are pushing ahead, for on the list of
contributions the leading Cinque Port is but eighth on the list,—
Sandwich with 22 ships, Fowey leading with 47,
Yarmouth coming next with 43, followed by Dartmouth,
Plymouth, Shoreham, London and Bristol in the order
named.


The ships carried no ordnance, although cannon was
used in the same year at Crecy, but Jack fought in
complete armour with crossbows, pike, and, above all,
slings.

The siege of Calais lasted a )Tear : we do not re-tell the
beautiful story about Eustace de S. Pierre, not because we
are of those who don't believe it, for we do, but because it
has nothing to do with our History. At Crecy the van of
the English army was led by the Earl of Stafford, Lord of
Tunbridge Castle, and Lord Cobham with his contingent
of Kentish bowmen contributed no little towards the
victory.


All this glory of course meant heavy expense, and it was
to get the wherewithal to meet this expense that Edward
granted the following three important enactments.  
  
  
  1.—The illegality of taxation without consent of  
  
  
  Parliament (no new thing, but the
endorsement of a law which had but been too often
more honoured in the breach than in the  
  
  
  observance.)  
  
  
  2.—No alteration of laws without the consent of  
  
  
  Parliament (Laws were made by the King,  
  
  
  at tlie request of the Commons, with the assent  
  
  
  of the Lords. The division of Parliament into
two houses really dates from the last reign, but
the strong distinction in functions herein  
  
  
  marked does not appear before).
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 101 -->
  
  3.—The right to enquire into public abuses and to  
  
  
  impeach.  
  
  
  (Thus, Sir John Lee was impeached for
embezzlement in his office of Steward of the  
  
  
  Household).


In accordance with this, a levy was made upon imported
goods, and especially upon exported wool. In this levy
Kent stands second to Norfolk in the amount granted.
This leads us briefly to consider the Kentish wool trade,
which was first fairly established in this reign.


Cloth had long been made in England, but Kent, says
Philipot in 1659, was one of the first places where fine
cloth w-as manufactured. In 1337 weavers and clothmen,
principally Flemings, were invited over to work up the
raw material which had hitherto been sent over to
Flanders for that purpose. The inducements offered by
Edward's agents are amusingly practical enough to be
quoted:


"You have to be up very early in the morning, and sit
up very late at night, and work very hard all the day, and
yet you get nothing better than herrings and mouldy
cheese to eat with your bread. Now take our advice. Go
over to England, and learn my countrymen your trade,
and you will find yourselves welcomed wherever you go.
Besides, you will be fed on beef and mutton till your
stomachs are full; your beds will be good, and your
bedfellows better, for the richest yeoman in England will not
disdain to marry their daughters to you, and they are such
beauties that every foreigner commends them."


Special enactments were passed for the protection of
these foreigners, and after a Parliament at Rochester,
summoned expressly that commercial affairs should be
discussed by commercial men, the following statutes were
passed September 27th, 1337 :—  
  
  
  1.—Felony to carry wool out of the kingdom,
{empty}2.—Only cloth made in England to be worn.  
  
  
  3.—No foreign cloths to be imported.  
  
  
  4.—A command for the proper treatment of the

foreign settlers, and franchises granted them.
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 102 -->

The result shortly was that the Kentish Weald became
as busy a hive of industry as was later on the Sussex
Weald to be busy with iron manufacture.


The Walloons, as they were called, came over in great
numbers, and made Cranbrook their centre, selected, no
doubt, on account of the beds of fuller's earth in its
neighbourhood, besides abundance of water and timber,
all requisites for the proper milling of cloth.


The tradition still lingers that when Queen Elizabeth
came to Cranbrook during her progress through Kent in
1573, and stayed at the George Inn, and received a silver
cup from the town, she walked to Coursehorne Manor, a
mile distant, entirely upon Cranbrook broadcloth.


Goudhurst, Tenterden, Hawkhurst, and Headcorn were
also busy manufacturing towns, and relics may yet be
ferreted out by the curious explorer in the shape of fine
old cloth-masters' houses, traditional factories, and ponds
formed by the damming up of streams.


These cloth-masters and their descendants, known as
the "Grey Coats of Kent," formed a much respected
political power in the land.


Broad minded as Edward had shown himself in not
merely encouraging this industry, but in inviting
foreigners by special inducements to come over and teach
his people to do what had hitherto been done abroad,
much of the benefit which should have accrued was
discounted by sundry vexatious petty regulations which
limited the manufacture of certain articles to certain
districts, and which restricted the individual action of the
manufacturers. The supervision exercised by the
Government measurers, weighers, and " aulnagers," was very
irritating; the Statute of the Staple, passed in 1353,
limited the number of towns in England and Wales where
wool before being exported had to be w*eighed by the
Standard and sealed by the Mayor to fifteen, and in Kent
the only Staple towns were Canterbury and Queenborough,
so that great delay and inconvenience was caused to
manufacturers by having to send their goods to one of
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 103 -->
these places before it could be sold or exported. Besides,
there were numerous petty limitations and restrictions
which tied the hands of manufacturers, such as the
prohibition to carry on more than one branch of the trade,
or to have more than one mill and two apprentices, and
the strict definition of colours to be employed.


However, the trade flourished, and the wealth
accumulated in the county must have been very great.


The year 1348 will ever be memorable in the annals of
England as the year of the Black Death.


It entered Europe by a Genoese port in the Straits of
Kertch, whither it was brought by the overland caravan
route from China. It arrived in England in August,
1348, at Melcombe Regis in Dorsetshire, travelled rapidly
through Dorset, Devon, Somerset, Bristol, Gloucester, and
Oxford, and reached London in November, whence it
spread to the Eastern and Southern Counties, and through
Yorkshire even to the Welsh mountains.


It was not so bad in Kent as elsewhere—for instance, in
the West Riding of Yorkshire where two-thirds of the
parish priests died, or in Nottinghamshire where one half
died, or in Norwich where the proportion was about the
same, but it was bad enough to leave traces which have
hardly yet been effaced altogether.


It has been estimated that during the years 1348 and
1349 about one half the population of England, say about
2,500,000 people, died of this plague.


The symptoms were sudden swellings in the groin,
armpit, or neck, red spots on breast and back, vomiting,
blood spitting, and delirium. The attack was appallingly
sudden, the illness rarely lasted more than three days, and
the only escape from it seemed to be to get on to water.


With regard to its progress in Kent. The diocese of
Canterbury was peculiarly exposed to contagion, as
through it ran the chief roads to the Continent, and it
possessed the seaports of Dover and Sandwich. Three
archbishops succeeded in a few months, and one at least is
known to have died of the plague. "In 1348," writes
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 104 -->
Stephen Birchington, " arrived the common death of all
people... and by this pest barely one third part
of mankind were left alive. Then also there was such a
scarcity and dearth of priests that the parish churches
remained almost unserved, and beneficed parsons, for fear
of death, left the care of the benefices, not knowing where
to go."  
  
  
  o1


It is however recorded that out of the eighty monks at
Christ Church, Canterbury, only four died, this singular
exemption being attributed to the purity of the Monastery
water. Two Masters were appointed to the Eastbridge
Hospital in a very short time. The Prioress of St.
Sepulchre's, and the Prior of St. Gregory's died. At
Sandwich the cemetery is described as filled to overflowing.
Sir Thomas Dene of Ospringe died on May 18th, 1349,
and in less than four months was followed by his wife and
two daughters.


As to the Diocese of Rochester, William Dene, a monk,
w*rites :


\"The Bishop of Rochester out of his small household
lost four priests, five gentlemen, ten serving men, seven
young clerks, and six pages, so that not a soul remained
who might serve him in any office. At Mailing he blessed
two abbesses, and both quietly died, and there were
onlyleft four professed nuns and four novices. The bishop
remained at Hailing and Trottescliffe, and, alas for our
sorrow! this mortality swept away so vast a multitude
of both sexes that none could be found to carry the
corpses to the grave. Men and women bare their own
offspring on their shoulders to the church, and cast them
into a common pit. From these there proceeded so great
a stench that hardly anybody dared to cross the
cemeteries."


As chaplains and paid clerics refused to work except at
higher salaries, they were ordered to under pain of
suspension.  
  
  
  Dene goes on :  
  
  
  " So great was the deficiency of labourers and workmen
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 105 -->
of any kind that more than one-third of the land all over
the kingdom remained uncultivated. The labourers and
skilled workmen were imbued with such a spirit of
rebellion that neither King, law, nor justice could curb
them. The whole people for the greater part ever came
more depraved, more prone to every vice, and more
inclined than before to evil and wickedness, not thinking
of death nor of the past plague, nor of their own
salvation. And priests, little weighing the sacrifice of a
contrite spirit, betook themselves to places where they
could get larger stipends than in their own benefices."


The results of this terrible visitation were far reaching
and long lasting. The first great immediate result was
the utter dislocation of the labour market. In Kent
entire districts remained waste, and grass sprang up in the
streets of once busy towns, partly on account of
emigration, but chiefly simply because there were no hands
to work. Combinations of labourers for higher wages,
the refusal of tenants to pay the old rents, and their
evacuation of holdings when rents were not reduced led to
the passing in 1349 of the Statute of Labourers, by which
it was enacted that everyone under sixty, man or woman,
free or bond, not having a livelihood or ground to
cultivate, should be obliged to serve any employer who
should require them at the old rate of wages in the
neighbourhood. Migration to other counties was forbidden,
and those w*ho broke their agreements were imprisoned
and branded with F for " false."


This was followed by what is probably the first
regularly concocted strike in our history, and by a
constant flow of emigration. To counteract this latter an
order was sent December 1st, 1349, to the Mayor and
Bailiffs of Sandwich and Romney, " to stop the passage
beyond the sea of them that have no mandate, especially
if they be Englishmen, excepting merchants, notaries, and
the King's envoys."


Other proclamations followed to the effect that harvesters
and others were not to claim more than the old wages,
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 106 -->
that Abbots and employers of labour would be fined for
giving higher wages, and that almsgiving to vagrants was
to be discontinued.


Another result was a tremendous rise in prices,
especially of fish. Dene writes that there was such a
dearth and want of fish that many who had been wont to
live well had to content themselves with bread and
pottage, and that in Lent there was such a lack of fish
that four herrings were ordained to be sold for a penny.


Another important result was that bailiff farming by
land owners died out, and that as there was no capital
available for the working of farms, the ordinary leasehold,
such as we now have, came in. Thus tenant farmers
became numerous, the famous class of the English yeoman
was created, the land passed out of the hands of the old
feudal owners, and in Kent to a great extent sheep grazing
and pasture took the place of arable land.


Necessarily the wool trade of Kent was for a time
entirely paralysed.


The church, as we have seen, was sorely smitten by the
Plague. Such service as was performed was done by
novices, and in many churches there was no service at all.
Many ordinations of seculars had to be made to fill up,
somehow, the vacant places; the abuse of pluralities grew
apace, and the effect upon the monastic life was such that
it really never recovered. " In short," says Cunningham,
\"the steady progress of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
was suddenly checked in the fourteenth."


William Dene, before quoted, after describing the
sadness of the poor old bishop of Rochester in his retreat
at Trottescliffe says :


"In every manor of the bishopric buildings and walls
fell to ruins, and in that year there was scarcely a manor
that returned £100. In the monastery of Rochester there
was also such a scarcity of provisions that the community
were troubled with great want of food." The Prior
however, he remarks, always managed to live well. The
bishop visited Mailing and Lesnes and found them so poor
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 107 -->
\"that from the present age to the Day of Judgment they
can never recover."


In 1352 the Prioress and nuns of St. James outside
Canterbury were freed from the tax of one-fifteenth
granted to the King, on account of their poverty. Even
Christ Church was badly hit; it lost cattle worth «£790,
and 1,200 acres of abbey lands were inundated by the
sea because there was no labour to keep up the sea walls.


In 1359 the scarcity of clergy, and the troubles arising
from the replacing of priests by scamps of all sorts, led to
the placing of the clergy under the Labour Laws. Even
in the architecture of the period following the Plague we
see the shadow- of this tremendous calamity. Church
building was stopped, and to this day we may note the
effect in the unfinished cathedral at Siena, and at home
in the wanting western towers and the Bachelors' Aisle of
St. Nicholas, Great Yarmouth. It has been observed too
that the Perpendicular Style happened to succeed the
Decorated just at the time when the paralysis of labour
was most complete, and that this is the style which calls
for the smallest play of imagination and fancy. Late
fourteenth century stained glass too is a rarity, for even
the great west window of Canterbury, dating from this
period, is but a heterogenous collection of old glass.


AVe have seen that one great result of the Black Death
was the debasement of ecclesiastical life by the almost
necessary introduction into it of incongruous and
illassorted elements. The fruits of this were not long in
showing themselves, for in 1360 Wycliffe began to preach
against the abuses in the church generally and against the
Mendicant Friars in particular, and the Lollards became a
power in the land. We may perhaps find three chief
causes for the early success of the new movement :  
  
  
  1.—The increasing bitterness of the contest between  
  
  
  Crown and Parliament with the Papacy.  
  
  
  2.—The strong feeling amongst the laity against the

extravagance and dissoluteness of the clergy.
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 108 -->
  
  3.—The general European upheaval caused by the  
  
  
  progress of learning and the unwillingness of  
  
  
  the lower orders to submit to bondage.


As we have said, Wycliffe's chief attack was directed
against the so-called Mendicant Friars, who, however, had
swollen into rich and important communities who practised
everything but what they preached, and through them,
against the Papal power. " The burden of Wycliffe's
teaching," says Mr. Froude, "was the exposure of the
indolent fictions which passed under the name of
religion in the established theory of the Church."
Wycliffe's points were specially the disposition by the
Pope of all the benefices in church patronage, his
claim of first fruits, and the intrusion of foreign
priests into English livings, as exemplified by the
Archdeaconry of Canterbury, one of the richest English
benefices, which was held by an Italian. "Great houses
make not men holy," said the Reformer, and against these
vast nurseries of vice and hypocrisy he sent his preachers,
who spoke to the people in their own English tongue, with
such success that until well into the next reign Lollardry
was at any rate connived at. No doubt, over-zeal carried
Wycliffe's disciples sometimes too far, for Hall the
Chronicler speaks of the Lollards as resembling the
Elizabethan Puritans, characterised by the moroseness which
proscribed all cheerful amusements, an uncharitable
malignity which made no distinction in condemning the
established clergy, and a narrow prejudice which applied
Jewish law to modern institutions. We shall have more
to say about Lollardry under the two following reigns, but
we allude to it here as being one of the results of that
convulsed state of society consequent upon the Black
Death which was to culminate in the great popular rising
under Wat Tyler in the next reign.


In 1346 was instituted the Order of the Garter, and on
the original roll are the names of three Kentish Knights,
the Earl of Stafford, Governor of Tunbridge Castle; Lord
Burgherst, Warden of the Cinque Ports and Constable of
Dover Castle; and Sir Walter de Pavely.
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 109 -->

In 1350 there was a sea fight off Winchelsea, known in
history as " Les Espagnols Sur Mer," at which the King
and Black Prince were present, resulting in the defeat of
the Spaniards and the capture of seventeen of their ships.
The English archers contributed chiefly to this victory.


In 1356 was won the glorious victory of Poictiers, and
the next year the Black Prince arrived at Sandwich with
his prisoner John, King of France, whence he passed by
Canterbury, where he had a magnificent reception, to
London, into which he made the famous entry familiar to
the most juvenile readers of history. From London the
French King was brought to Eltham Palace, where he was
feasted and treated, according to the chivalrous usage of
the day, rather as a guest than as a prisoner. It is no
doubt from this circumstance that the grand old hall now
standing is still known as King John's Palace, although
our King John had no more to do with it than Julius
Cæsar, for it was not built until the reign of Edward IV.


Four years later the French King obtained his release
by the Treaty of Bretigny. He came by Dartford, rested
at Rochester, dined at Sittingbourne, supped and slept at
Ospringe. Thence he came to Canterbury, halting at the
Leper Hospital of St. Nicholas, Harbledown, at all of
which places he left presents, and to the shrine of St.
Thomas, whereat he and his son Philip made offerings of
jewels and money.


Finding, however, that he could not honourably abide
by the terms of the Peace he voluntarily returned and
lived at Eltham.


In 1360 the French landed at Winchelsea, burned the
town, and committed atrocities in the country round about
as black as those which the Black Prince afterwards
committed in Guienne. It was after this destruction of
Winchelsea that Edward I. planned the new town on the
block system, never completed, but of which the traces are
distinct to-day. This was an exciting and anxious period
for our Kentish coast folk. Never a week passed without
the bells being rung and the beacons which stood on every
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 110 -->
church tower being fired to give alarm of a French or
Spanish landing. Every countryman was a soldier, every
longshoreman a fighting sailor, every religious house and
manorial hall an armoury and a barrack.


In 1361 the Black Prince married his old love, his
cousin Joane, daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of
Kent, known as the Fair Maid of Kent, although she was
a widow and thirty-five years old. In commemoration of
this the Prince founded a chantry in the crypt of
Canterbury, afterwards used as the Huguenot Church. Two of
the ceiling bosses of this chantry are adorned with portraits
in stone of himself and his bride—a branch of sculptural
art which became popular at about this time.


In 1368 the King was at Stonar—then a rival port to
Sandwich—and thence he sailed with his four sons for
Calais, starting between daybreak and sunrise and arriving
the same evening, whieh was considered a smartish bit of
work in those days. In 1376 the Black Prince died in
the Archbishop's Palace at Canterbury (See Note D at end
of Flantagenet Kent), after having tried the effects of the
waters of the spring at Harbledown, just under the old Leper
Hospital, which is still called the Black Prince's well, and
is still reputed a curative of sore throats. He was buried
in the Cathedral. The next year died the King.
Unhappily his reign, which was marked by so much that was
great and glorious, closed in dishonour and shame—our
arms unsuccessful in France, and our masses at home only
waiting for the opportunity to assert themselves, the
Church in a degenerated condition, and the great nobles
preparing amongst themselves the explosive train which
was to burst over the country with such fearful force in
less than a century's time.  
  
  
  Richard II. 1377-1402.


It was a troublous inheritance for the boy of eleven
who now succeeded to the crown, and the storm which
burst would have put upon their mettle the ablest and
most powerful of his predecessors.
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 111 -->

It had been long gathering; indeed, the Rebellion of
Wat Tyler, to which we allude, may be included amongst
the results of the Black Death thirty years before, as
well as being what Mr. Froude calls " a mischievous
comment on Wycliffe's doings." That it was inevitable is
evident from the nature of its surroundings, for it is
notable that at the time of the Rebellion the condition of
the people, so far from being as miserable as it had been, was
characterised by such an amelioration that landlords and
labour employers were complaining of the continual
craving for " bettering themselves," and of the increasing
daintiness of their subordinates.


The nobles were suspicious of the King, hated the
clergy, and eyed with suspicion the growing power of the
merchants; the nobles and the leading clergy were trying
to keep down the labourers aud serfs; labourers and serfs
were trying to rise; the friars, once the champions of the
poor, were now their plunderers; the church was wealthy,
but shared no burdens; Piers Plowman's Creed, circulated
in purer English than were the contemporary writings for
the classes, had produced a profound effect amongst the
masses, hitherto uninspired by any writing by one of
themselves, and, like all uninspired masses, lacking
cohesion, and almost unable to put in black and white
what they wanted.  
  
  
  Generally speaking, the main springs at work were

{empty}1.—The progressive improvement of Society.  
  
  
  2.—There gradual diffusion of knowledge.  
  
  
  3.—The increasing pressure of taxation.
{empty}4.—The perpetual ity of War.


The Poll tax of three groats per head, levied 1379-1380,
as Mr. Green says, " not only brought the pressure of war
home to every household, but goaded into action precisely
the class which was already seething with discontent."


It was John Ball, a Yorkshireman, although Froissart
calls him " a mad priest of Kent," who ventilated the
popular feelings. He was a parochial chaplain, a sort of
artizan among ecclesiastics, whose duty it was to take care
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 112 -->
of churches, and his sermon upon the slavish doctrine
enforced by the Statute of Labourers, with its famous
text :  
  
  
  " When Adam delved and Eve span

Who was then the gentleman?"

procured his imprisonment at Maidstone by Treasurer
Hales.


In 1381 Commissioners were sent into Kent to find out
whv the Poll Tax had failed to produce what was expected
of it, and these men, rough and ready Jacks in office,
under the pretext of discovering the real ages of women,
often insulted them. Leg, the Kentish Commissioner, and
his fellow, went to the house of John Tyler, at Dartford,
and thus insulted his daughter. Leg was knocked down
and killed by the infuriated father. The incident has,
perhaps, been exaggerated in importance, but it was the spark
which set the combustible mass in a blaze, a tremendous
ferment ensued amongst the confederacies of villeins to
obtain relief from burdensome feudal customs, and Wat
Tyler, of Maidstone, or "John Rakestraw and Watt
Tegheler, of Essex," were chosen popular leaders.


One party of the insurgents seems to have gone to
Rochester, where Sir Simon Burley had imprisoned a
Gravesend man, whom he claimed as his bondsman, and this
man was released. At the same time Ball was released
from Maidstone, and the Essex men, who had really first
opened the ball, hearing ofthe Kentish movement, hastened
up as allies. Another party went to Canterbury, released
the prisoners from the castle, entered the house of William
Medmenham, a manor steward, burned his books and rolls,
seized the sheriff, ill-treated, if they did not kill, obnoxious
individuals, found the roll of the three great subsidies,
burned it, plundered houses, and were in armed possession
of the city.


On June 12th the Kentish contingent assembled on
Blackheath, and being joined there by men of
Huntingdon, Cambridge, Essex, Sussex and Surrey, numbered
about one hundred thousand. Then the mighty tide rolled
on Londonwards.
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 113 -->

The insurgents, after their excesses at Canterbury, seem
to have made their march in tolerable order, but the
exceedingly ill-timed rebuff' of the Earl of Salisbury at their
request for an audience with the king, to the effect that
they were not properly dressed or in a fit condition to
approach royalty, put an end to their moderation. Some say
that it was this incident which inspired the preacher Ball
with the distich text for his sermon.


At any rate, arrived in London they proceeded to acts
of violence. John of Gaunt was particularly hateful to
them for his acts of tyranny and outrages of sanctuary,
despite the gloss which Shakespeare has cast over his memory,
and they burned his palace in the Savoy. They poured
into the Temple, pulled down the lawyers' houses and burned
their books, rolls and deeds; they burned the Fleet prison;
they burned the monastery of St. John of Jerusalem at
Clerkenwell; they seized Hales the treasurer and
Archbishop Sudbury, wdio had imprisoned Ball, and murdered
them.


It was Sudbury who in 1370, when Bishop of London,
met a party of pilgrims bound to Canterbury, stopped
them, and told them they were fools if they expected to
get plenary absolution for visiting Becket's shrine,
whereupon a Kentish knight, Thomas of Alden, prophesied a
bad end for him. Wat Tyler's special grievance against
him was prodigal expenditure of public money. He was
beheaded on Tower Hill and his head set on London
Bridge. Miracles were said to be performed at his tomb
in Canterbury; his head is still shown in the vestry of St.
Gregory's church at Sudbury, and that it may be his has
been perhaps confirmed by an examination made of his
coffin at Canterbury in 1833, when it was found that in
the place of the head was a ball of lead. At Mile End the
King managed to pacify the Essex rebels under Jack
Straw, but Tyler liked not the security given, and at
Smithfield met the King and made the following demands :  
  
  
  1.—Abolition of serfdom.  
  
  
  2—.Liberty of buying and selling in all fairs and  
  
  
  markets.  
  
  
  i
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 114 -->
  
  3.—Reduction of land rents to a greater equality.  
  
  
  4.—General pardon.


From the nature of the first demand it would appear
that slavery was not extinct in England. This was
probably not so much a demand of the Kent men as of
those from the other associated counties, for there was
certainly less personal slavery in our county than
elsewhere, not only on account of the peculiarly free character
of the Kentish tenures, but from the fact that the greater
number of Kentish villeins were in ecclesiastical service,
and therefore not so liable to be treated as mere animals
as if they were under lay lords. It was probably accepted
as a legal maxim under Edward I. that everybody of
Kentish origin was free from personal villeinage, and
although the rule was not always observed, it was generally
allowed. An examination into Gavelkind tenure will show
that personal slavery had little or no chance of existence.
The second demand was a blow at the monstrous abuse of
the "rights" of certain corporations, communities, and
individuals to control markets, at the monopolies of rich
abbots and merchants, and their efforts to prevent
freedom of trade, and to hinder by tolls the entrance of
produce into towns.


This the King granted, and he acceded also to the
demand that all warrens in parks and fields should be
common—this was a hit at the severe game laws of the
period.


Then comes the episode of the death of Wat Tvler and
of the young King's presence of mind. Whether Wat
Tyler's head had been turned by the apparently ready
concessions made and he behaved insolently, or whether Sir
William Walworth had an inkling that an order had been
given by Tyler that at a given signal the King's people,
but not the King himself, were to be killed, and thought
to anticipate it by knocking the rebel leader down, cannot
be decided. At any rate Tyler was knocked down and
killed, the Kent men at once bent their bows and
prepared to avenge their leader, and without doubt a
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 115 -->
bloody conflict would have resulted but for the cool
gallantry of Richard, who rode forward, and exclaimed :


\"Good people ! You want a leader ! I will be your
leader!"


This won the hearts of the crowd, and they peacefully
followed the King into the fields and received' his royal
confirmation of the promises made.


The immediate danger over, however, the young King
seems to have been persuaded that concessions extorted by
force were unworthy of the royal dignity, revoked them,
there was a general muster of the military tenants of the
Crown, the rebels were hunted down and ruthlessly
butchered, and John Ball, who had been the soul, as
Tyler had been the arm, of the movement, was hung,
drawn, and quartered.


The results of this famous Kentish rebellion were that
the villeins were taught to combine for defence, and it
led to enquiries into the tyrannies exercised over the
people.


In 1382 Richard and his Queen, Anne of Bohemia,
landed at Dover, whence they proceeded to Canterbury
and Blackheath, where they were met by the Lord Mayor
and citizens of London in full state.


It was iu this year that Wycliffe was condemned by the
National Synod under Archbishop Courtenay for his
sermon against transubstantiation, his heterodox idea that
an ecclesiastic who was himself in a state of mortal sin
could and should have no control over the faithful, his
assertion that Scripture prohibits ecclesiastics from holding
temporal possessions, and that where repentance is sincere
confession is useless.


No better proof however was lacking that Lollardry,
although proceeded against, especially at Oxford, its
hotbed, was connived at during this reign than the fact that
Wycliffe himself, its arch-priest, was allowed to end his
days peaceably, having on the eve of his death completed
his magnum opus—the Bible which bears his name.


The King kept the Christmas of 1386 at Eltham with
great state.  
  
  
  i -z
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 116 -->

Iii 1396 Parliament met at Eltham to discuss the
second marriage of the King with the "little Queen"
Isabella of France, and Froissart, who was present, speaks
enthusiastically of the magnificence of this Kentish palace
of the Kings of England. In the same year the marriage
was celebrated in the church of St. Nicholas in Calais.
There is nothing more in this reign connected with the
history of our county to detain us. How the King
during his closing years found himself friendless and alone
in his realm; how by the machinations of the unscrupulous
and powerful Henry of Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
he was confronted before Parliament by thirty-three
articles of accusation and deposed; how the Duke of
Northumberland by treachery obtained the Royal person
and confined him first in Leeds Castle, then at Flint
and lastly at Pontefract, are matters of national
history.


The last scene of his life, as told by Shakespeare, who
drew it from Holinshed, was royally magnificent. His
resistance to Sir Piers Exton and eight other assassins
was worthy of his warrior forbears; two of them he slew
ere Exton felled him from behind, and travellers two
centuries and a half later reported that tokens of the fray
were still visible in the chamber of death.


There are two other versions of Richard's death. One
is that he died of grief and self-starvation; the other
that his jailors starved him to death. Sir Walter Scott
alludes to a tradition that Richard escaped from
Pontefract and got to Scotland, and, without absolutely
believing in it, adds that he deemed it worthy of grave
attention.


Under Richard our Navy was in a bad state; there
was no discipline on the ships, so that mutinies were
frequent, commanders were incapable, and provisioning
bad. In 1379 when Sir John Arundell's squadron was
overtaken by a storm, sixty women were thrown
overboard ! The French insulted our coasts, and the
Spaniards sailed up the Thames and burned part of
Gravesend.
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 117 -->

By the end of the Fourteenth Century, at which we
have arrived, English became the established state and
popular tongue. By a Statute of 1362 pleadings in the
Courts of Law were ordered to be in English " because
the French tongue is much unknown"; and yet this same
Statute is in Norman French! By the year 1385 in all
the grammar schools English was the prevailing language.
Edward III., thoroughly English otherwise as he was,
habitually spoke French. Indeed the few specimens of
his English which have come down to us are the motto
he bore on his shield at a tournament at Canterbury in
1349:  
  
  
  Hay ! Hay ! the wythe swan !
Ey Godes soul I am thy man !"

and expressions of his such as " It is as it is ! " and " Ha !
St. Edward ! Ha ! St. George ! "


And the outcome of this development of a national
tongue was naturally a national literature. The first poet
worthy of the name since the Conquest was Laurence
Minot, who, between the years 1333 and 1352 celebrated
the victories of Edward III. in ten poems. The Vision of
Piers Plowman, probably by AVilliam Langland, an allegory
of life in the style of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, of about
14,700 verses, came forth in 1362, and was followed some
twenty years later by the still more famous Piers
Plowman's Creed, a diatribe of the English peasant against the
clergy.


Gower was of a Kentish family, but of his three poems
only one, the Confessio Amantis, is written in English.
Finally we have Chaucer who, although London born,
probably resided in Kent, was a Kentish knight of the
shire in 1381, and is best known by his Kentish
Pilgrimage. "Certes" says he in 1392, " there be some
that speke theyr poysy matter in Frenche, of whyche
speche the French mennes have as good a fantasye (i.e., get
as much fun out of) as we here in hearing French mennes
Englyshe"—quite sufficient evidence that French had
ceased to be the native tongue of Englishmen and was
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 118 -->
only known to those to whom it had been taught by a
master.


As for our Kentish dialect, the best contemporary
specimen extant is the Ayenbite of Lnwyt, or the Remorse
of Conscience, a literal translation of a French treatise by
Dan Michel of Northgate, Canterbury, a brother of St.
Augustine's monastery.


Although with no title to be placed under this
particular period of history, we may append a few of the
most striking features of the old Kentish dialect.  
  
  
  1.—Using ch instead of k. Ex. : cherl for carl.
{empty}2.—,, v for f.,, vinger for finger.
{empty}3.—,, z for s,, zour for sour.
{empty}i.—Metathesis : birch for rich, gurt for great.
(This peculiarity is also remarkable in
Somersetshire, where the name Richard
becomes Hurchard, ' red ' becomes ' hurd,' and
so on).
{empty}5.—Using ps for sp. Ex. : waps for wasp.
{empty}6.— „ g for y.
{empty}7.—,, o for a.
{empty}8.—,, e for a. Ex. : epple for apple; gled for
glad.
{empty}9.—,, e for i.,, melk for milk.
10.—,, y for ey.,, gryhound for greyhound.
11.—,, Reduplication of vowels. Ex's.: bryead
bread, che-ap for cheap.
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 119 -->
  
  Part III.—The Reigns of Henry IV., V., VI.;

Edward IV. and V.; and Richard III.  
  
  
  Henry IV. 1399-1413.


Henry, eldest son of Edward III.'s third son, John of
Gaunt, practically elected himself King of England, with,
of course, the assent of Parliament, although Edmund
Mortimer, Earl of March, great grandson of Lionel, Duke
of Clarence, second son of Edward III., really had a prior
claim. He was, however, but a boy six years old, and was
easily set aside. Under Richard II., as we have seen,
Lollardry was connived at, but at the accession of the new
King a general rectification of wrongs was looked for, and
the tide turned strongly against the AA'ycliffites.


So in the second year of this reign was passed the
Statute De Heretico Comburendo, which enacted that any
heretic who relapsed or refused to abjure his opinions
should be delivered over to the secular arm by the church
and publicly burned. This is notable as the first penal
religious Act in our history, by which is not to be
understood that heretics were never burned before this date.
On the contrary, they frequently were. This Act simply
facilitated the process.


The danger apprehended from Lollardism was the close
connection between it and the cause of popular liberty.
What Piers Plowman's Creed did for the people as
members of a body politic, as would-be free Englishmen,
AVycliffe's Bible, Wycliffe's tracts against Romanism, and
the plain, popular language in which his heterodoxy was
set forth, supplemented and accentuated. So great had
been this influence too, that, although the bulk of the
Lollards were to be found among the people, sympathy
with the teaching, if not actual conversion to it, had
spread from the people up to the merchants, and even to
the Knights.
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 120 -->

During the reign of Henry IV. Lollardry spread so
rapidly that the majority of the House of Commons were
inclined to it, and they passed two petitions, one against
the clergy, and one in favour of the Lollards, complaining
of the excessive wealth and extravagance of the former,
and praying* for a repeal of the Act De Jseretico.


In Kent the Lollards were very strong, and there is no
doubt that in our county, although the above Act was a
severe check, the new creed was cherished secretly by
thousands up to the date of the Reformation.


In 1395 Sir John Oldcastle, of Cooling Castle, first
appeared as a public Lollard agitator, openly championing
the opinion that the Pope's power of excommunication
should be limited. In 1409 the Archbishop of Canterbury
complained that Oldcastle gave refuge to a man who did
not fear to preach "contrary to our constitution and
without asking either our leave or that of the diocesan of the
place in the churches of St. Mary and St. Werburg in
Hoo, Halstow, and Coulyng, and to blaspheme and mock
at evangelical decrees and sanctions of the holy fathers,
sowing damnably weeds and tares and heresies and errors."
The chaplain was ordered to be arrested, Cooling church
was interdicted, but this was taken off through the
influence of Lady Oldcastle of Cobham. In 1413
Oldcastle was brought up before Archbishop Arundel, and
gave his very unvarnished opinion about relics and images.  
  
  
  The rest of his career comes under the next reign.


Oldcastle's association with Kent does not end with his
share in the Lollard movement. Mr. Halliwell, the
Shakesperian commentator, considers that Sir John
Oldcastle was the prototype of Sir John Falstaff. At any
rate, the name of Sir John Oldcastle stood in the place of
Sir John Falstaff until the time of printing the play of
King Henry the Fourth; and Mr. Payne Collier in support
of Mr. Halliwell's theory quotes from a play by Field in
1618, entitled " Amends for Ladies :"—  
  
  
  '' Did you never see
The play where the fat knight, bight Oldcastle,  
  
  
  Did tell you truly what this honour was?"
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 121 -->

This can only apply to Falstaff's famous soliloquy in
Henry IV. : Part I., Act 5, Scene 1.


Again, in the course of the play Prince Henry calls
Falstaff, " My old lad of the Castle."


As we are on Shakesperian ground, we are reminded
that the inimitable exploits of the Prince and his
companions on Gads Hill took place in this reign.


In 1402 Henry married Joan of Navarre by proxy at
Eltham, which became a favourite resort of the King and
Queen. In 1406 Joan spent the summer at Leeds to
avoid the plague which raged in London and the
neighbourhood. In 1409 Christmas was spent in great
state at Eltham.


Henry IV. lies in a splendid tomb of contemporary
Decorated work in Canterbury Cathedral, and when his
Queen died in 1437 she was laid beside him. There long
obtained a tradition that the King's body was not there at
all, based upon the assertion of one Clement Maydestone
that he had helped to throw the Royal corpse overboard
during a storm which arose as it was being conveyed from
AA'estminster to Gravesend, and that the Royal coffin alone
was placed in the tomb. An examination was made of the
tomb in 1832, and the King's body is said to have been
revealed, but the absence of such insignia as were always
buried with a Royal body, and the presence of hay-bands
and of a rude cross of wych-elm, such as a superstitious
man would probably have put in after the commission of
such sacrilege, would seem to corroborate tradition.  
  
  
  Henry V. 1413-1422.


Shakespeare says that it was from Hampton that
Henry V. sailed with the army which was to win
Agincourt, but all older authorities say that Dover was the
port of embarcation.


At any rate, it was at Dover that he landed after the
victory, and Lingard describes how " the crowd plunged
into the waves to meet him, and the Conquerer was
carried in their arms from his vessel to the beach." His
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 122 -->
course towards London was one long triumphal procession,
and on Blackheath the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of
London and four hundred citizens clothed in scarlet met
him.  
  
  
  Holinshed, however, remarks


\"The King, like a grave and sober personnage, and as
one remembering from whom all victories are sent, seemed
little to regard such vaine pompe and shews as were in
triumphant sort devised for his welcoming home from so
prosperous a journie; insomuch that he would not suffer
his helmet to be carried before him, whereby might have
appeared to the people the blowes and dints that were to
be seene in the same; neither would he suffer any ditties
to be made and sung by minstrels of his glorious victorie,
for that he would have the praise and thanks altogether
given to God."


Mr. Outram Tristram's remark upon which we entirely
endorse : " A pious decision, but one which must have
been extremely unsatisfactory to town councillors who had
launched forth in the way of dress and decorations, and to
the thousands of Londoners who had flocked out to
Blackheath to see the show."


At Agincourt Sir Thomas Erpingham led a body of 300
Kentish bowmen, whose skilful disposition so as to catch
the heavily mailed French cavalry in an ambush
contributed in no small degree to the victory. Their banners
are said to have been emblazoned with the device of a tree,
representing Swanscombe AYood, with an arm holding a
sword above the motto " Invicta."


In 1421 the King with his bride, Catharine of Aralois,
landed at Dover, where, says Monstrelet, she was received
as if she were an angel of God.


In the meanwhile Lollardism was about to receive its
last blow. Every effort to turn Oldcastle orthodox failed,
and he, alarmed, shut himself up in Cooling Castle, and
refused to come out. Whereupon he was arrested, tried,
excommunicated, and imprisoned in the Tower. Thence
he contrived to escape, probably with the aid of the
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 123 -->
London 'prentices, who, like the Kent men, were at any
rate strongly anti-clerical, if not Lollard.


In 1417 he was discovered in Wales, brought to London,
and burned alive in 1418.


Thus came to an end as a movement in open operation
what has been termed the Pre-Reformation. Lollardism
was a child of untimely birth; the times were not ripe for
so sweeping a change; men's minds were not made up,
and when AVycliffe's influence failed, as it did when he
strayed beyond the main objects of his attack, its backbone
was broken. Englishmen were never fond of fanatics, and
the later Lollards were certainly fanatics.


What is still called the Lollards Hole in the little town
of AArye is a relic of these days—a subterranean chamber
of massive masonry opposite the end of Church Street, aud
from its appearance evidently once connected by a passage
with the old Manor House close to the church.  
  
  
  Henry VI. 1422-1461.


The young King being but nine months old the
government was placed in the hands of the Duke of Bedford as
Protector, and, during his absence, of his brother Gloucester,
whilst the person of the infant was confided to Henry
Beaufort, bishop of Chiehester, a legitimised son of John
of Gaunt by Catharine Swynford.


In 1145 Henry arrived with his bride, Margaret of
Anjou, at Dover. On Blackheath, which seems to have
been from time immemorial the precise spot at which the
welcome of the great City of London should be displayed
to distinguished strangers, the Duke of Gloucester met
her, accompanied by five hundred men wearing a daisy
badge, and escorted her to Greenwich Palace. From there
the Royal party returned to Blackheath, whereon the Lord
Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen met them attired in blue
gowns, with embroidered sleeves and red hoods.


In honour of the new Queen Eltham Palace was
magnificently renovated.  
  
  
  But the miseries of this reign were not long in showing
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 124 -->
themselves. After the brilliant illumination of Agincourt
dark indeed were the days of war for our armies in
France. Between 1421 and 1453 we were defeated in
half-a-dozen pitched battles, prominent amongst which
were Beauge, Montargis, Rocroy, Fourmigni and Castillon;
we were driven from fortress after fortress; Orleans fell,
and even Guienne, which had been English since the
reign of Henry II., and, under the inspiration of Joan of
Arc—a heroine whose fair fame not even the acutest of
modern idol breakers has been able to tarnish—France
exhibited those marvellous powers of recuperation which
have so often been the admiration and envy of other States.


The ill success of the war corresponding so miserably
with the exactions and taxes levied for its maintenance a
loud and fierce cry for reform broke forth in the shape
of the " Complaint of the Commons of Kent," in 1450.  
  
  
  This set forth;  
  
  
  1.—A demand of the truth of rumours that Kent

was to be turned into a deer forest as
punish
ment for the killing of William de la Pole, Earl

of Suffolk, who, accused of selling Anjou and

Maine to France, of being the cause of the loss

of Normandy and Picardy, and of the
move
ments of the House of York, in attempting to

fly to France had been captured by Kentish

ships, and after a mock trial by the sailors on

the beach at Dover had his head knocked off

on the gunwale of a boat.
{empty}2.—The frequent violation of laws which exempted

the Cinque Port barons from subsidies.
{empty}3.—The tyranny of the King's officers at Dover.
{empty}4.—That " the people are not allowed to have their

free election in the choosing of knights for the

shire, but letters have been sent from divers

estates to the great rulers of all the county,

the which enforceth their tenants and other

people to choose other persons than the common

This was presented and refused. So on June 1st,
1450, the Kent men, said to have been provided with
funds by London merchants, assembled on Blackheath to
the number of twenty thousand, under the command of
Jack Cade of Ashford. On June 7th the King hurried
up to London, and on the 11th he marched against the
rebels, who took up a position at Sevenoaks, awaited the
Royal troops and beat them; and, by the end of June, a
reinforcement of Sussex men coming in, the whole array
marched back to Blackheath. On July 3rd the Kentish
rebels, encouraged by the news that the Essex men were
mustering in great numbers at Mile End, marched on
London, and, after some parleys, were admitted over
London Bridge.


Cade made his head quarters at the Hart Inn, which, by
the way, was not even the immediate predecessor of the fine
old White Hart which was pulled down a few years ago,
and which was famous as the spot where Mr. Pickwick
engaged the services of Mr. Samuel AA'eller, for the back part
of this latter inn was burned in 1669, and the whole of it
in the great Southwark fire of 1676.


The proceedings of the night of Sunday, July 5 th, are
best described in the words of Hall the chronicler :


\"The rebels, who never soundly slept for fear of
sudden chances, hearing the bridge to be kept and manned
(they were in Southwark) ran with great haste to open the
passage, where between both parties was a fierce and cruel
encounter. Matthew Gough, more expert in martial feats
than the other captains of the city, perceiving the Kentish
men better to stand to their tackling than his imagination
expected, advised his company no farther to proceed
towards Southwark till the day appeared, to the intent that
the citizens hearing where the place of jeopardy rested,
might secure their enemies and relieve their friends and
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 126 -->
companions. But this counsel came to small effect, for the
multitude of the rebels drove the citizens from the wooden
piles at the bridge fort to the drawbridge, and began to
set fire in divers houses.


\"Alas ! AVhat sorrow it was to behold that miserable
chance ! For some desiring to eschew the fire leapt on his
enemy's weapon, and so died; fearful women with children
in their arms, amazed and appalled, leapt into the river;
others, doubting how to save themselves between fire, water
and sword, were in their houses suffocated and smouldered;
yet the captains, nothing regarding these chances, fought
on this drawbridge all the night valiantly, but in conclusion
the rebels got the drawbridge, and slew John Sutton,
alderman, and Robert Heysand, a hardy citizen, with many
other, beside Matthew Gough, a man of great wit, much
experienced in feats of chivalry., This hard and
sore conflict endured on the bridge until 9 o'clock in
the morning in doubtful chance and fortune's balance :
for some time the Londoners were beat back to the piles at
St. Magnus Corner, and suddenly again the rebels were
repulsed and driven back to the piles in Southw-ark, so that
both parties being faint, weary and fatigued, agreed to
desist from fight and to leave battle to the next day on
the condition that neither Londoners should pass into
Southwark nor the Kentish men into London."


Shakespeare places the fighting and the death of
Matthew Gough at Smith Held, but the old accounts agree with
Hall. The rebels at any rate seem to have won the bridge,
marched through London by Cannon Street, where Cade
struck London Stone with his sword and boasted of his
mastery of the capital, to Smithfield.


Here took place the murder by the rebels of Lord Say
and Seal, who in Shakespeare it will be remembered
describes Kent in Latin as a good country inhabited by bad
people, but, being asked to explain himself, tries to save
his head by the oft-quoted flattery :  
  
  
  " Kent in the Commentaries Cæsar writ,  
  
  
  Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle;
Sweet is the country, because full of riches,
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;"
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 127 -->
  
  But he merely wasted breath and was executed.


Cade then negotiated, repeated the demands made in the
complaint, with the addition of a general pardon. This
was all granted and the Commons of Kent dispersed, but
Cade, like Tyder, was not satisfied about the integrity of
the Royal word, remained under arms, and with a few
hundreds of followers marched to Rochester for the sake of
plunder, whence they proceeded to Queenborough, made an
unsuccessful attack on the castle, and as they now began
to quarrel among themselves over their plunder Cade left
them, fled inland, was killed by Alexander Iden, a
gentleman of Kent, and his head fixed on the South Gate of
London Bridge.


AVhether Cade was killed at Cade Street, near
Heathfield in Sussex, as the monument there erected states, or
near Hothfield in Kent, is a question not likely ever to
be settled to the satisfaction of everybody. The opinions
on each side are pretty equally divided.


Philipot and Kilburne writing in 1659, Harris,
Seymour, Hasted, Speed, and the Grey Friars' Chronicle, say
that Iden, a gentleman of, if not sheriff of, Kent, killed
him at Ripley Court, between AA*estwell and Hothfield in
Kent. Shakespeare lays the scene of Act IV., Second
Part of King Henry the Sixth, in " Kent : Iden's
Garden." Hasted speaks of a field at Hothfield known in
his time as " Jack Cade's Field," and Mr. Furley says that
a field in AA'estwell, belonging to the Tufton family, part
of the Park Farm, is still called " King Henry's Meadow,"
and suggests that it was purchased with the reward money
paid to Iden.


Horsfield, Durrant-Cooper, Hume, Skinner, Fabyan,
Holinshed, Creasy, and the English, Grafton, Hall's, and
Baker's Chronicles, and, above all, Mr. Lower, decide for
Heathfield in Sussex.


Holloway, in his History of Rye, alludes to the Issue
Rolls of the Exchequer in which appears a reward paid to
John Davy for help in capturing Cade at Heathfield in
Sussex. Mr. Lower argues for Sussex by saying that Cade
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 128 -->
is an old Sussex name about Heathfield, and points to place
names like Cade's Castle, Iden's Gate, Cade Street, and so
forth, but Mr. Furley rejoins that Cade is quite as common
a name in Kent as in Sussex, and fails to see why Cade
should have gone so far out of his way. At the same
time he concedes that the concensus of opinion is in
favour of Sussex.


For ourselves we believe that Cade, being an Ashford
man, would naturally, when hard pushed, make for a
district where he had friends to hide and protect him, and we
cannot help believing that near Hothfield is to be
distinguished as the scene of his capture and death. (See
Note E at end of Chapter).


So far from being " the scum of Kent " the followers of
Cade numbered amongst them one knight, eighteen
esquires, seventy-four gentlemen, and five clergymen, and
the wide-spread sympathy with the rebellion is perhaps
testified by the fact that the quarters of the twenty-six
leaders executed after the King's Commission of Enquiry
at Canterbury were sent to such distant places as Norwich,
Salisbury, Gloucester, Chiehester, Portsmouth, Colchester,
Stamford, Coventry, Newbury, and AVinchester.


Even after this signal punishment disturbances occurred.
One Poynings got up an agitation at Westerham in 1453,
and there were riots at North Cray and Farningham in
1454, but the spirit of the rebels was crushed, and the
Kent men were glad to ask their sovereign's pardon on
Blackheath, clad in their shirts, with halters round their
necks.


AVe now come to one of the most momentous and
miserable periods of our History, that of the AVars of the
Roses. Moreover, although it is an historical period, as
distinguished from a semi-mythical period, it is more
difficult to examine than any other, even of eailier date,
for so torn and convulsed were the districts over which the
war was carried, that old records perished, no new records
were made, many of the oldest families disappeared never
to rise again, and the only employment was that of arms.
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 129 -->
In the fourteen pitched battles fought between the years
1455 and 1485 it has been calculated that more
Englishmen lost their lives than during the Hundred Years' war
with France.


And yet we are told that in the districts not
immediately affected by the war, our own county amongst them,
not only did life go on much as usual as regards business,
but that the Courts of Justice never interrupted their
sittings.


In reality it was an aristocratic war, a struggle between
rival nobles, the result of an utter breakdown of
government, of debt, anarchy, and the independence of the great
lords. Its chief result was that final shattering of the
feudal system, till now the great check upon unlimited
monarchy, which paved the way for the despotism of our
Tudor monarchs.


Ostensibly the rival claims of the York and Lancaster
factions were these :—


Richard Duke of York was descended from Lionel Duke
of Clarence, third son of Edward III.


Henry VI. was the great grandson of John of Gaunt,
the fourth son of Edward III.


York's claim was based upon the seniority of his
ancestor; Henry's upon the right of hereditary succession.


Henry IV., son of John of Gaunt, had ousted Richard
II. and had been duly elected King, and the Lancastrians
rationally argued that this could not be upset by any claim
based upon the seniority of Clarence.  
  
  
  The act which immediately led to war was this :—


Henry VI. was mentally afflicted, so Richard Duke of
York was made Protector. But Henry recovered, and the
Duke of Somerset, York's rival, who had been impeached
and imprisoned in the Tower by York, was restored to
favour by the influence of the Queen. York, thereupon,
backed up by the nobles and by the County of Kent, took
up arms. This was in 1455.


In 1459, to come at length to matters of county interest,
after the defeat of the Yorkists at Bloreheath, the Earl  
  
  
  K
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 130 -->
of Warwick and his father, Salisbury, fled to France.
Warwick—afterwards famous as the King Maker—tried
to get the governorship of Calais, but Somerset kept it
from him, so Warwick landed at Sandwich, where he found
Lord Cobham with 4,000 men awaiting him, and marched
on London, being joined on the way by Kent people
until it is said the Yorkist army numbered 40,000. This
must be an exaggeration, for the population of the county
at that time would hardly permit of the enrolling of
36,000 men during the short course of a march from
Sandwich to London.


However, this was no doubt the army which won the
battle of Northampton in 1460, in which the King was
taken prisoner and brought to Eltham, where he passed
his time in hunting.


After this battle a " Parliament" so-called was held,
and York came over from Ireland to assert his claim. He,
however, consented to the decision that Henry should
continue to reign during his life, and that he should
succeed him. But Queen Margaret of Anjou was not the
woman to acquiesce in an arrangement by which her son
would be kept from the throne, she collected an army in
the North, and utterly defeated York at the battle of
AVakefield, in 1460.


It was to block her progress on to London that
AVarwick's Kentish army marched Northward. At St.
Albans the Queen defeated AVarwick in 1461, and had she
marched at once on London she might have seized the
capital unopposed, but instead of doing so she wasted time
in executing prisoners, and, moreover, young Edward Duke
of York had beaten the other division of her army under
Jaspar Tudor at Mortimer's Cross, so she had to retreat.


After her went the Kentish army and took part in the
great victory at Towton in 1461, which has been called
the Pharsalia of England on account of its momentous
consequences, Prince Edward being crowned Edward IV.
of England.  
  
  
  By the will of Sir John Fogge masses were ordered to
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 131 -->
be said in Ashford Church for the souls of the Kent men
who were killed at Towton, in which battle, says Drayton,
Lord Cobham's bowmen did wonders against the
Lancastrians. The commander of the Yorkist van, Robert
Home of Appledore, was killed at Towton.  
  
  
  Edward IV. 1461-1484.


In 1462 the King levied what is believed to be the first
so-called Benevolence in our history, addressing the Mayor
of Fordwich and asking " voluntary contributions to resist
Henry and Margaret and the Duke of A'alois, calling
himself King of France."


In 1464 the King married Elizabeth AA'oodville, or, to be
correct, Elizabeth Gray, and the pair remained at Eltham
Palace until the coronation. On their way from Eltham
to London for this ceremony the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
met them at the foot of Shooters Hill. The existing
portions of Eltham Palace, we may remark en passant,
were built during this reign.


"In 1470," Holinshed says, "The Kent men whose
minds be ever movable at the change of princes, go to
London, rob, kill, and release prisoners from the King's
Bench, and would have gone farther had not AVarwick
crushed them."


This was on account of AVarwick the King Maker's
change of front. From being a supporter of Edward
and an enemy of Margaret, he turned to her side and
promised to place Henry VI. again on the throne. AAThy
he did this we cannot learn from the confused history
of the times, perhaps he was offended at the secrecy of
Edward's marriage with Elizabeth Gray.


AA'arwick kept his word; Edward was defeated near
Doncaster and fled, Henry was re-enthroned, but in 1471
Edward landed at Ravenspur, gained London, where he
was popular, at the battle of Bamet defeated and killed
AA*arwick, and in turn re-ascended the throne.


In 1471 took place Falconbridge's Lancastrian rising in
Kent. This seems to have been a regular County affair,
although the accounts of it are most meagre. At any rate,  
  
  
  K 2
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 132 -->
the fact that a rising in such a cause should even receive
encouragement in a County which had hitherto shown
itself so thoroughly Yorkist would seem to bear out the
character borne by the Kent men of the day, as given by
Polydore Vergil, who says, " Civil dissensions, whereunto
the Kentish people are most prone, as well for that they
can hardly beare injuries as for that they are desirous of
■novelties."


The people seem to have gone in for the very fun of
fighting and excitement, for Falconbridge landed without
opposition, "and finding" says the old chronicler, "many
of the count rye of Kent were assentynge and cam with
theyr good wills, as people redy to be appliable to such
seditious comocions," besides many who had no stomach
for fighting, and " would righte faine have sytten still at
home," were compelled to join, or to send substitutes, with
the result of an army of 17,000 men.


From Sittingbourne, Falconbridge addressed the Mayor,
Aldermen and Commonalty of London for the release of
the wretched Henry VI. But their reply was to the effect
that as Edward IV. had commanded them on their
allegiance to keep London, they will oppose his coming.


Falconbridge sailed up the Thames and made his head
quarters at Southwark, giving out that he had come to
free Henry VL, then burned part of the bridge and some
of the houses in Southwark, when he found that the Mayor
and Aldermen intended to be as good as their word and
from Baynard Castle to the Tower were at their guns. He
then turned Eastward, attacked Aldgate with 5,000 men,
but the portcullis was dropped and a number were
entrapped; it was pulled up again, Robert Bassets,
Alderman of Aldgate, made a sortie, drove the rebels as
far as St. Botolph's, where other forces joined in against
them, and drove them to Mile End and Stratford, where
they scattered and fled.


Edward now came up to London, whereupon
Falconbridge retreated to Blackheath, thence to Sandwich, where
he was captured, pardoned, but beheaded all the same.
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 133 -->

Edward held a Court of Enquiry at Canterbury into the
conduct of Kent, and heavily fined the County, so that
"the Kynge made out of Kent niyche goode and lytelle
luff." This was followed by merciless executions, especially
at Canterbury and Rochester and Blackheath.


Edward IV. amidst the turmoil of his surroundings
seems to have shown that under more favourable
circumstances he might have been a good, if not a great,
King, although inclined to abandon himself to pleasure.


The woollen industry of Kent was the subject of many
protective statutes in this reign, amongst which was the
quaint one for the regulating of burials in wool, a frequent
remark appended to the entries in our burial registers even
so late as the beginning of the present century being
\"buried in wool." Indeed it is very remarkable that
although the adage "inter arma leges silent" holds
perfectly good with regard to the reign of Edward IV.,
inasmuch as this was the first reign during which no
statute was passed for the redress of grievances, or
maintenance of the subject's liberty, our trade attained a
pitch of unexampled prosperity, and the evil effects of the
terrible war were local and rapidly effaced. It was in this
reign, in 1462, that the famous charter was granted to
Romney Marsh by which the government of the district,
not merely as regards internal affairs, but for the purposes
of defence, was settled upon a Bailiff, twenty-four jurats,
and the Commonalty, a form of government which exists to
this day, excepting that the twenty-four jurats have
dwindled to five. The " Grand Lath" or meeting is
still held at Dymchurch on the Thursday in Whitsun week
and four " Petty Laths " are held in the year. At these
Laths, in a quaint old house called New Hall, all the
business of the Marsh—of its drainage, of the all
important maintenance of the sea wall, its groynes and its
sluices, the levying of "scots" or rates, is transacted.


It is to this reign that we owe most of the semi-military,
moated houses of which so many still exist in Kent.
AVhere the houses have disappeared the moats often
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 134 -->
remain, of which very good specimens may be seen at
Sevington, near Ashford, and close to AA7ilmington Farm,
near Kennington. Statelier buildings of the type of parts
of Knole and Hever exhibit very fairly the change
wrought in the condition of society by the shattering of
the baronage.


AA'illiam Caxton is the chief Kentish figure of this
reign. Born in the AA*eald, " where I doubt not is
spoken as broad and rude English as in any place of
England," he started in business in the Almonry at
AVestminster, whence from his press he issued the
Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, for whom he had a reverence
amounting to worship, the poems of Lydgate and Gower,
the Chronicle of the Brut, translations innumerable, service
books, sermons, chivalrous tales and ballads. His first
work was the moral treatise entitled The Game and the
Playe of the Chesse, dated 1474; his last was the Golden
Legend, 1490.  
  
  
  Richard III. 1483-1485.


Kent was, of course, concerned in the premature attempt
of Henry of Richmond to oust the usurper Richard from
the throne. There was an assembly at Maidstone under
Richard Guildford, and Richmond was proclaimed, but the
times were not ripe and Richard was too firmly seated yet
to be shaken. There was also attempted a rising at
Gravesend of some five thousand men in connection with
the Duke of Buckingham's plot, but upon his betrayal and
execution it evaporated.


In 1720 Dr. Thomas Brett showed the Earl of
AVinchilsea at Eastwell an entry he had found in the
church registers under the year 1550, as follows :—  
  
  
  "Richard Plantagenet was buryed the 22nd daye of  
  
  
  December."


The legend was then still extant about the bricklayer
employed at Eastwell when Sir Thomas Moyle built the
house in 1544, who attracted his attention by reading
from a Latin book at every spare moment, and who, when
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 135 -->
questioned, spoke about having been summoned as a boy to
Bosworth Field to see his father. The entry more than
probably records the death of this old man, whom Moyle
pensioned and settled in a cottage, which was standing at
the beginning of this century not far from where the lane
turns off from the AVestwell road to Eastwell church, and
who was either a real or natural son of Richard III.


A plain, uninscribed tomb in the chancel of Eastwell
church is pointed out as that of the Plantagenet.


Perpendicular was the prevalent architecture of the loth
century, and in Kent we have many notable examples of
it, especially in the church towers. Ashford, Lydd,
Cranbrook, Westerham, Goudhurst, Lenham, Charing, Chartham,
Lyminge, AA'ingham, Tenterden, Rolvenden and Headcorn
may be chosen as specimens of Kent churches in which
Perpendicular work, either in towers, or windows, or doors
is to be remarked.


In Canterbury Cathedral we get all Chillenden's work of
this period—the screens of the cloisters, the Baptistry,
and the AVarriors' Chapel; also the tombs of Henry IV.
and of Chichely, the Chantry of Henry IV., the Oxford or
Dunstan's steeple, and the Dean's or St. Mary's Chapel.
The glass in the great North window of the AA'est transept
and Bourchier's tomb are of this period, and in 1495 Bell
Harry Tower was raised to its present height.


The decline of the Cinque Ports during the 15th
century is very notable, although some exploits are to be
recorded.


In 1405 their squadron captured off Milford Haven the
French fleet sent to assist Owen Glendower, and in 1407,
under Henry Page, it surprised and took 120 French
merchant ships " Laden with salt, iron, oyle, and no worse
merchandise."


It was for the coronation of Henry IV. that the Ports
claimed and won, even from so powerful a rival as the
Abbot of Westminster, the right that their barons should
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 136 -->
bear the royal canopy, four to each of the four staves, and
of sitting at the right hand table next the King at the
Coronation banquet.


Sandwich was fast ceasing to be a principal port of
communication with the Continent, owing to the silting up
of the harbour, although it was not to lose its commercial
importance for some time yet. Romney, despite the
determined efforts of its burghers, had practically given
way as a port to Hythe, and Hythe was already on its
downward course. Winchelsea had never recovered the
French visitation in Edward III.'s reign. Dover and
Hastings alone were in a prosperous condition.


A Kentish apprentice's indenture of Edward IV.'s time
may be interesting.


\"Between John Gare of St. Mary Cray, cordwainer, and
AValter Byse of AA'imelton in the same county.


AA'itnesseth that said AValter hath covenanted with said
John Gare for the time of eight years, that John Gare will

his craft, and John Gare shall give him first year three
pence in money, and add three pence a year, to the last
year when he shall give him ten shillings. And AValter
Byse shall truly keep his occupation, and do as John
Gare bids him, and shall go neither to " rebeld" or
sport during the said eight years without leave of John
Gare."  
  
  
  NOTES ON PLANTAGENET KENT.  
  
  
  A.


The appearance of Otford Castle, like that of another
archiepiscopal residence, Charing, is a pathetic sermon on the mutability
of human grandeur. After it passed into the hands of Henry
VIII. it seems to have been utterly dishonoured and neglected. In
1570 Lombarde writes that nothing was left but the hall and the
chapel. Hasted at the end of the last century saw but two towers, a
wall, and part of the outer court. Until quite recently the tower
was used as a smithy. The stones were carried away for buildings
in the neighbourhood; carved oak panels and quaint old
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 137 -->
woodwork are still to be found put to base uses, and at thc Bull Inn is
still a carved chimney piece with figures said to represent Henry
and Catharine of Arragon. It is said that George IV. once came to
Sevenoaks for a review, but not having time to come to Otford the
local enthusiasts stripped the tower of its ivy and whitewashed it
so that the King might see it from Knowle.  
  
  
  B.  
  
  
  Wye, it may be remembered, was the manor first given as a

reward for services performed at the Conquest, and was bestowed
on the Abbey of Battle. In Anglo-Saxon times it was a Royal
Vill, and it was the privilege of the men of the lands in Wye to
guard the King at Canterbury and at Sandwich for three days if he

came there.  
  
  
  C.  
  
  
  " All the brothers," said St. Francis in his Rule, "are to be clad  
  
  
  in mean habits, and may blessedly mend them with sacks and  
  
  
  other pieces... they must be meek, peaceable, modest, mild  
  
  
  and humble... they are not to ride unless some manifest  
  
  
  necessity or infirmity oblige them... they must beg in order

to get necessaries of life, but they must receive them in kind, never
in money. The brothers shall not make anything their own,
neither house, nor place, nor any other thing; and they shall go
confidently to beg alms like pilgrims and strangers in this world

serving our Lord in poverty and humility."  
  
  
  Yet thirty-two years after they appeared in England theyalready possessed forty-nine convents; in the magnificent church of
the Franciscans on the site of Christ's Hospital—"three hundred
feet long, ninety-five wide, and sixty-four high, with columns and
pavement of marble,"—were buried the hearts of Isabella, wife of
Edward III., and of Queen Eleanor, and Kings and Princes vied in
enriching the building; and the no less magnificent church of
Black Friars was especially favoured by Edward I. A minute
description of one of the splendid Dominican Convents is given in

Piers Plowman's Creed, written at the end of the 14th century.

Gradually not only reformers like Wycliffe, but theold-established monks, began to hate the friars. Thomas Walsingham, a
monkish contemporary of Chaucer, after a violent tirade against
the friars, adds that a popular saying in his time was : "He is a

friar, therefore a liar."  
  
  
  D.  
  
  
  With reference to the locality of the Black Prince's death, Mr.  
  
  
  Furley, who is almost invariably accurate, says : " Lingard is in  
  
  
  error in stating that his death took place in Canterbury; and

Hasted, on the authority of Stow and others, makes the same
mistake. He died in the Palace of Westminster, whither, in
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 138 -->
order to be nearer Parliament, he had removed, either from his
house in Fish Street Hill or from his Castle in Berkhampstead. He
was buried by his own directions in Canterbury Cathedral."

Since writing the above I have renewed my search for evidence
in support of the theory that Cade was killed at Hothfield and
not at Heathfield.


I can find no trace of a " Cade's Field " at or near Hothfield, or of
a "King Henry's Meadow" at Westwell, and no such names
appear on a ny maps that I have consulted.


At Ripple Court Farm, near Hothfield railway station, known to
have been the property of the Idens at the time of Cade's rebellion,
the tradition is of course firmly adhered to that Cade was killed in
the garden, and, as I have already said more than once, it is unjust
to reject tradition as worthless because nothing tangible exists to
give it colour. At the same time it must be conceded that if there
is no historical evidence to establish the fact that Cade was killed
at Hothfield there is no more to strike the balance in favour of
Heathfield.

  Henry A*II. 1485-1509.

IN 1495 Perkin AVarbeck, a creature of Edward IV.'s

sister, the Duchess of Burgundy, pretending to be

Prince Edward, one of the young princes said to have

been, and now known to have been, murdered by Richard
III. in the Tower, tried to effect a landing in Kent. He
arrived in Pegwell Bay and sent one hundred and twenty
of his followers ashore to ascertain the feeling of the
country people. The Kent people, however, were too well
inured to alarms and excursions not to be on their guard
against surprise and treachery, and the Gentlemen of Kent
inland were ever ready at the first flicker of a beacon, or
the first boom of an alarm bell, to buckle on their harness
and present themselves at the meeting point ready and
equipped. And so in this case, Perkin AArarbeck's men
landed in Kent, but never got out of it again, for they
were seized, chained in couples, and sent up to London,
where they were executed.


Henry was very pleased at this, and thanked the
County.


Strutt's account of a May festival held at Greenwich,
from a manuscript of this reign, may be interesting to
some. A number of gentlemen, professing* themselves to
be the servants of the Lady May, promise to be in the
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 140 -->
Royal Park at G reenwich, day after day, from two o'clock
in the afternoon till five, in order to perform tlie following

sports : —

On May 14th they meet at a place appointed by the

King, armed, to keep the field, and to run with every
comer eight courses.


On the 15th the archers took the field to shoot "at the
standard with flight arrows."


On the 16th they held a tournament with "swords
rebated to strike with every comer eight strokes."


On the 18th they were ready to wrestle with all comers
in all manners of ways.


On the 19th they were to enter the field, to fight on foot
at the barriers, with spears in their hands and swords
rebated by their sides, and with spear and sword to defend
their barriers; there were to be eight strokes with the
spear, tw*o of them " with the foyne " or short thrust, and
eight strokes with the sword, every man to take his best
advantage with gript or otherwise.  
  
  
  On the 20th they were to cast the bar.


And this went on through May and a fortnight into
June.


(These extracts which we shall give from time to time,
as we survey the festive and dramatic period of our history,
may not be severe history, but are assuredly quite as
illustrative of history as columns of facts and figures.)


In 1497 the King required a loan for the war in
Scotland. Cornwall was asked, that is, ordered, to
contribute, and the people of Cornwall, who, like our
Kentish folk, were ever ready in sturdy resistance to
attacks on popular rights and liberties, resented being
asked to contribute to a cause with which they in their
remote corner of our isle had so little concern.


Flammock, a lawyer, argued that the Border counties
should defend the Border, and that counties hundreds of
miles away should no more be expected to pay for war
against the Scots, than the Border Counties should be
taxed to pay for the defence of the Southern Coast.
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 141 -->

The Cornishmen asked to be led into Kent " as the
people there were the freest in England," and would
certainly help them. But Henry had so graciously
rewarded the Kent men for their part in the affair of
Perkin AA*arbeck that they remained loyal and would not
stir to help the Cornishmen.


The Cornishmen, however, came eastward and encamped
on Blackheath. The King recalled the troops destined for
Scotland, and collected a large army in London. One
portion remained in St. Giles's Fields, another, under the
Earls of Oxford and Suffolk, made a circuit of the plateau
of Blackheath and got to the rebels' rear. A third force
under Lord Daubeny attacked in front; two thousand of
the dispirited and ill-armed rebels were killed, and the rest
fled. Lord Audley, Flammock and Michael Joseph were
taken and executed, but the usual stern justice of the times
was not meted to the poor rabble.


In 1489 the great event of the next reign was
foreshadowed by a cursory visitation of monasteries, which
revealed the existence of great evils.


Henry VII. preferred Greenwich as a palace, but at
Eltham his children were educated, and he built a
handsome front to the Palace. He also greatly embellished
the Archbishop's Palace at Canterbury, and here made his
will.


It is interesting to note that during this reign hops were
first introduced into Kent from Flanders.


Sir Edward Poynings, the author of the important law
bearing his name, by which it was enacted that no law was
to be passed in Ireland without the consent of the English
House of Commons, was a Kent man by birth, says
Fuller; " he was a great favourite of Henry VIL, who
made him Knight of the Garter, Constable of Dover
Castle, and Lord AVarden of the Cinque Ports."  
  
  
  Henry VIII. 1509-1547.


The young King who now ascended the throne was
hailed by such a burst of general enthusiasm as had not
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 142 -->
been accorded to any of his predecessors, and nowhere
more cordially than in the County of Kent, of which he
was a man born and bred. It was a manly age, and the
good people of Greenwich loved to hail as their lord and
master a man who topped most of them in inches, who
could wrestle with the burliest, heave the bar with the
strongest, and draw a bow which taxed the muscle of all
but picked archers. Nor was Henry a mere magnificent
animal : he was a linguist, a skilled musician, more than a
dabbler in metaphysics, and a pretty rhymster, and, above
all, he very soon showed that he was an Englishman to the
backbone. The chief events of Henry's reign are the
Suppression of the Monasteries and the Reformation, and,
for the convenience of readers, we shall proceed at once to
describe the first, especially in its relation to our county,
and continue to its end without turning aside here and
there to deal with contemporary events, which in due
course shall likewise have undivided attention.


In the year 1511 the shadow of the most tremendous event
of this reign was cast by the visitation of certain religious
houses suspected of not being satisfactorily managed.
Archbishop AVarham instituted this visitation, and in
Kent he visited in Canterbury, Christ Church, St. Gregory's,
St. Sepulchre's, and St. James's. He was also at AVingham
College, St. Martin's, Dover, the Maison Dieu at the same
place, Folkestone, AATye College, Davington, Ospringe,
Faversham, Leeds, Minster in Sheppey, Maidstone, and
Combwell.


The summary of his report was that, although no grave
charges of immorality had been established, there were
constant complaints about the alienation of funds, badness
of food, general laxity of management, and altogether
evidences of a progressive decay in the monastic spirit.


In April, 1524, AVolsey, bearing this report in mind, and
wishing to found colleges at Oxford and Ipswich, got a
bull from the Pope to suppress such houses as failed to
come up to a certain standard, and in June, 1525, the
Royal consent was given to the Act, but affairs of state
<!-- Leaf 181 -->
  
  pOHKS riortatT.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P181_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 143 -->
delayed its being put into operation. A tremor of alarm
ran through the entire ecclesiastical community, and every
device was compassed, if not to stave off the disaster, at
any rate to minimize its effects. The first result of this
was no doubt the affair of the Maid of Kent.


In the year 1525—we abridge from Cranmer—Elizabeth
Barton, a girl of humble parentage living at Aldington,
had a severe illness, during which she declared she had
trances and revelations of Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, and
the state of souls departed. In one of these she was
warned to go to Our Lady of Court-at-Street, or, as it was
sometimes written, Courthope Street (the next village
to Aldington towards Lympne, where the walls of
the chapel still remain); and when she was brought
thither and laid before the image of Our Lady her face
was wonderfully disfigured, her tongue hanging out, and
her eyes being in a manner plucked out and laid upon her
cheeks, and so, greatly disordered. Then there was heard
a voice speaking in her belly as it were in a tun. This
continued three hours, the voice speaking sweetly of
Heaven and terribly of Hell. She then had a command
from God in a vision to become a nun. These trances
always happened on the anniversary of the Conception of
the Blessed Virgin.


Masters, the successor of the great Erasmus at
Aldington, saw that in this girl might be found a powerful
weapon to aid the threatened Church. Great multitudes
of people of every condition came from all parts to
Courtat-Street, and she was generally believed to be a divine
prophetess against the prevalent apostasy.


With the aid of Edward Booking, a monk of Christ
Church, Masters obtained her removal to the Nunnery of
St. Sepulchre's in Canterbury.


Cranmer continues, " That having trances every week or
fortnight she was visited by great numbers of people,
chiefly clerical, who communed with her concerning the
King's marriage." (The italics are ours, for herein lies the
occasion of her downfall, it being remembered that Henry
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 144 -->
was at this time striving with might and main to obtain a
divorce from Catharine of Arragon so that he might marry
Anne Boleyn). "And the heresies and schisms of the
realm. Of divers matters she had secret knowledge
which she pretended came from Heaven, and even wrote
letters purporting to come from Heaven to earthly
creatures."


Elizabeth Barton was backed up by such men as
Warham, Fisher, and Sir Thomas More. She told AVolsey
that if he sanctioned the King's divorce from Catharine,
and the. marriage with Anne Boleyn, God would punish
him, that the King would not continue King a month
after his marriage, but would be destroyed in six months
by a plague of unheard of severity.


The King at first paid no attention to what he deemed
but the incoherent babblings of a mind bereft of reason,
but at last it was time to curb the strong feeling which
was being excited against the marriage.  
  
  
  Cranmer says in 1534 :—


"I sent for this maid to examine her, and afterwards
she went before Mr. Cromwell. And now she has
confessed that she never had a vision in her life, but feigned
them all, and that a letter purporting to have been written
by Mary Magdalen in Heaven and sent to a widow in
London was really written by Hawkeh irst, a monk of St.
Augustine's.


She was executed at Tyburn in 1534, and with her
two Friars observant, two monks, and one secular
priest. Sir Thomas More and Bishop Fisher, who had
been strongly influenced against the King's marriage by
the maid, were committed to the Tower about the time of
her execution. Edward Booking, John Dering, Richard
Master, and Thomas Abell, the chaplain and intimate
friend of the Queen, were all involved in the affair. Dering
had written a book against the marriage, but burned it.
Abell's book, a violent diatribe under the motto of
\"Invicta Veritas," procured his committal to the Tower,
wherein may still be seen his rebus deeply carved in the
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 145 -->
wall of the AVhite Tower, and he was afterwards burned at
Smithfield. The Charterhouse in London, and the Houses
at Richmond, Sion, and Greenwich were also implicated,
and were amongst the first to be visited in 1534. The
Greenwich friars in particular are described as being " very
stiffe." In 1534, when Henry was disappointed of getting
Papal consent to his divorce from Catharine, he determined
to separate from the Papacy altogether and become
Supreme Head of the Church, and this momentous decision
was put into effect by the Act of Supremacy. The
monastic orders had naturally always been the strongest
supporters of the Papal authority, and no doubt at this
great crisis employed all their great influence in promoting
discontent at the new order of things. Henry therefore
resolved to deprive them of their means of opposing him
and to use their wealth for the defence of the country.


Cromwell was made the King's vicar general, and the
visitation of the monasteries was resolved upon.
Eightysix questions were drawn up by Leyton, who was one of
the commissioners for Kent, of which the following were
the principal:  
  
  
  1.—Had the houses their full numbers according to  
  
  
  their foundation ?  
  
  
  2.—Did they perform Divine worship at the appointed  
  
  
  times 1  
  
  
  3.—Were their vows observed ?  
  
  
  i.—Did they live according to the severities of their  
  
  
  Orders 1  
  
  
  5.—Did nuns go abroad, or were men allowed to  
  
  
  enter nunneries 1  
  
  
  6.—AVhat priests did they use for confessors ?  
  
  
  7.—How were their lands and revenues managed?


The visitors drew up and presented a report to
Parliament asserting that property was misapplied, rules
systematically violated, gross immorality indulged in, and
disgraceful impostures, such as the Rood of Grace at
Boxley, practised by the monks to draw money from
the purses of the pious.  
  
  
  L
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 146 -->

A beginning was made with the smaller monasteries,
which, without wealth or influence, could be easily dealt
with, and in 1536 an Act was passed for the suppression
of 376 monasteries having incomes of less than £200 per
annum. This meant spoil to the amount of £30,000,
besides £100,000 in plate.  
  
  
  In Kent this affected the following houses :  
  
  
  St. Radegunds, Bradsole, Premonstratensian Abbey.  
  
  
  Combwell - - - Augustine Priory.
Bilsington - - - Augustine Priory.  
  
  
  Horton - - - Benedictine.
Mottenden - - - Trinitarian.  
  
  
  AA'ingham, Langdon, and St. Gregory's, Canterbury.


By this step a large number of persons who could not, or
would not, be transferred to the larger monasteries became
beggars, and went about the kingdom exciting discontent
and sympathy by the story of their sufferings. This
culminated in the great Lincolnshire and Yorkshire
insurrection known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, to help in the
suppression of which Kent sent 2,500 men.


Although the Act for the suppression of the smaller
monasteries was passed in 1536, visitations ofa preparatoiy
nature had already been made. Thus, under date of
October 22nd, 1535, Layton, one of the commissioners for
Kent, writes :


\"I rode back to take an inventory of Folkestone, and
thence back to Langdon, where I sent Bartlett, your
servant, with my servants to circumcept the abbey, and
keep all starting holes. I went alone to the Abbot's
lodging joining upon the fields and wood, even like a cony
clapper full of starting holes, and was a good space
knocking at the door. I found a short pole axe and dashed the
door in pieces, and went about the house with the pole
axe, for the Abbot is a dangerous, desperate knave and
hardy. Finally, the Abbot's ' gentlewoman' bestirred her
stumps towards her starting holes where Bartlett took the
tender damoisell."  
  
  
  The house is described as decayed, with no grain or
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 147 -->
  
  victual; the Abbot as unthrifty, an " evil husband " and of

ill rule. He continues :  
  
  
  " The Prior of Dover and his monks are as bad as the

others. The Abbot of Langdon is worse than all the rest,
the drunkenness knave living. His canons are as bad as
he, without a spark of virtue." Dover is described as a

goodly house.  
  
  
  " Another priory called Fowlstone, ten or twelve miles  
  
  
  from Canterbury house in utterdecayPrior an apostate and runagate. Prior of  
  
  
  Dover excused himself, saying he had spent* much money

on the place."  
  
  
  This must not be confused with Folkestone, which is  
  
  
  described as " well repaired, Prior a very honest person and

a good husband."  
  
  
  About this time was exposed that famous piece of

clerical humbug known as the Boxley Rood. This was an
image of the Virgin, of which the body bowed, the
forehead frowned, and the lower lip dropped to the amazement
of the credulous bumpkins, and probably of a great many

who were not bumpkins.  
  
  
  It was shown at Maidstone and is described as made of

\"certain engines and old wire, with old rotten sticks at
the back of same which caused the eyes to move and stir
in the head thereof like unto a lively thing, and also the
nether lip hi likewise to move as though it should speak,

which was not a little strange."  
  
  
  "A brave fellow smelt the deceit, loosened it from the

wall, and exposed the trick—the juggler was caught." It
was taken up to London, made to go through its
performance at AATiitehall, and at Paul's Cross dashed to pieces and

burned.  
  
  
  About this a Maidstone man (probably a Lollard),

writes :  
  
  
  " Dagon was everywhere falling in England. Bel of

Babylon had been broken in pieces. A wooden god of the
Kentishmen had been discovered, a hanging Christ who
might have vied with Proteus, for he nodded his head,  
  
  
  i. 2
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 148 -->
winked his eye, wagged his beard, and bent his body
to reject and to receive the prayers of those who came
to him."


Besides the Rood, there was at Boxley a piece of St.
Andrew's finger set in silver, but at the Dissolution it was
in pawn !


At Otford there was a miraculous image of St.
Bartholomew, efficacious it was believed for the
propagation of the species. If a woman wanted a son she offered
a cockerel, if a daughter a pullet. "Thus," says
Lambarde, " the priest of Otford managed to purvey to
himself all the poultry in the neighbourhood, the
country women being as stupid as the capons they
brought."


This was exhibited before the King, who ordered it to
be removed.


The parson of Kemsing, too, drove a good trade upon
much the same lines. St. Edith, the local patroness, whose
name still clings to the quaint old well on the village
green, was reputed to have the pow*er of protecting
crops from disaster if she was properly approached.
People offered corn at her shrine, the priest took it,
\"hallowed " a small—very small—portion, which he
returned to the votary with the assurance that if it was
mixed with new seed all would be well, and kept the rest
for himself.


In fact, the whole country swarmed with lazy
ecclesiastics who throve and fattened upon the credulity of
the bumpkin, and in 1538 there was presented to the
King a petition against popery by the beggars of
England, which enumerated the vices and tyranny of the
\"bishops, abbots, friars, deacons, archdeacons, suffragans,
priests, monks, canons, pardoners and somners."


In 1537 Cranmer reported that the Kent people were
very obstinate in keeping their old holidays which had
been forbidden by the new laws for the redress of the
Church of England.  
  
  
  In 1538 it was determined that the name of Thomas a
<!-- Leaf 189 -->

KEM5ING.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P189_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 149 -->
Becket, who had become a positive object of idolatry,
should be removed from the list of hoiy^ people. So he was
formally7 cited to appear in Court and answer to the
charges brought against him. Thirty days were allowed
for his appearance, but as not even the age of a Boxley
Rood could produce Thomas from his four hundred year old
resting place, he was found guilty of rebellion,
contumacy and treason, his bones were ordered to be
publicly burned and all offerings at his shrine were
forfeited to the Crown. To this sentence a rider was
appended to the effect that as he had been killed in a riot
excited by his own obstinacy and intemperate language,
he was declared no saint, but rather a rebel and traitor
to the prince, and all pictures and images of him were
to be destroyed, all festivals in his honour abolished, and
his name erased from all service books.


This was carried into effect. After the mock trial the
clearance of the shrine began : the offerings and silver
filled twenty-six waggons, the jewels and the gold were
carried away in two strong coffers. So thoroughly was
the work of expurgation carried out that it is hard to
find Becket's name on any contemporary bull or
document; his figure was erased from every window and
picture and even the arms of the city and cathedral were
altered. (See Note A at tlie end of Tudor Kent).


In Canterbury Cathedral the only trace of a portraiture
which must have been well nigh ubiquitous is to be found
upon some fragments of painted glass, and in the
halfdefaced fresco upon the canopy of Henry IV.'s tomb. (See
Note B at the end of Tudor Kent).


The description given by Erasmus of the shrine as it
appeared not very long before its demolition may be of
interest:—


\"Iron screens prevent ingress, but allow a view of the
space between the extreme end of the church and the place
which they call the choir. Thither you ascend by many
steps, under which a vault opens entry to the north side.
There is shown a wooden altar dedicated to the Blessed
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 150 -->
Virgin, but not remarkable for anything save as a
monument of antiquity, putting to shame the
extravagance of these times. Here the saint is said to have made
his last farewell to the Virgin when his death was at
hand. On the altar is the point of the sword by which
the head of the most excellent prelate was cleft.
Descending to thc crypt, which has its own mystagogues,
we are shown the perforated skull of the martyr.  
  
  
  " ' Did you see the bones 1' " asks the inquirer.


\"' That is not allowed. But a wooden shrine covers the
golden shrine, and when that is drawn up with ropes it
shows inestimable treasures. The meanest part was gold;
every part glistened, shone and sparkled with rare and
very large jewels, some of them exceeding the size of a
goose's egg. The Prior with a rod pointed out each
jewel.' "


The lower part of the shrine was of stone in arches, and
between these arches sick and lame folk pushed and rubbed
themselves in the sure hope of being cured.


The year of spoliation happened to be one of the best in
the receipt books of the shrine. There were, for instance,
no offerings at God's altar, only £4 Is. 8d. at the Virgin
Mary's, but £954 6s. 3d., or more than £12,000 of our
money, at the altar of St. Thomas.


In September, 1538, Becket's bones and relics were
shown for the last time to a party of French ladies. In
1888 the skeleton of a large man with a deep incision in
his skull was found beneath the floor of the crypt, and it
is supposed that this may be the skeleton of the great
archbishop, which had been secretly removed by devout
persons at the first hint that the shrine was to be destroyed.


In 1539 all the greater monasteries were suppressed.
The heads of Glastonbury, Colchester and Reading refused
to submit, whereupon they were promptly arrested, tried
and executed.


In Kent this sweeping edict affected the following
houses :  
  
  
  Christ Church, Canterbury - Benedictine Mitred Priory.
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 151 -->
St. Augustine's, Canterbury - Benedictine Mitred Abbey.
(The site was turned into a deer park).  
  
  
  Faversham - Benedictine Abbey.
Dover - Benedictine Priory.
Dartford - Augustinian Nunnery.
Mailing - - Benedictine Nunnery.
Leeds - Augustinian Priory.
Rochester - - - Benedictine Priory.
Dover - - - The Maison Dieu.
Boxley - - - Cistercian Abbey.
Maidstone - - College.
Tunbridge - - - Black Canons.
Bayham - - - Premonstratensian Abbey.
Losenham - Carmelite Friars.
Canterbury - - - Grey Friars : turned into a
cloth factory.
Minster in Sheppey - Nunnery.


It must not be understood that all this ejectment and
spoliation meant the reduction of hundreds and thousands
of men and women to beggary. AA*here the visitors'
reports were favourable the ecclesiastics were pensioned for
their lives, the amount thus paid in Kent alone
amounting to £1,263 16s. 5d., that is, not far short of
£20,000 modern money. Moreover, the politic amongst
the great houses " surrendered " in time, and were for so
doing let off comparatively easily.


At the same time the blow fell very hardly on the
poorer classes. The monasteries had been their almshouses,
their poor houses, their hospitals and dispensaries, and in
many cases their schools. Their discontent was increased
by the new landlords spending their revenues at Court
instead of at the place where they were gathered, and by
the enclosure of common lands which ensued, and this
caused Ket's Norfolk rebellion in the next reign, whilst the
severe laws passed against beggars and vagabonds, then
for the first time necessary, testified to the distress which
existed.  
  
  
  Altogether it is estimated that between fourteen and
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 152 -->
fifteen millions sterling, modern money, besides jewels and
vestments, were netted by this move. The time for some
reform had evidently come, for during 100 years only eight
religious houses and seventy for purposes of teaching and
charity had been founded, whilst some 780 foundations
had decayed.


Thus was shattered the mighty monastic system of
England. Swift, however, and sudden as was the blow,
the traces of the monks footsteps remain indelible to this
day. Go where we will we strike them—here in the
tangible shape of some majestic ruin, so beautiful in its
forlornness that we forget the wantonness and
wickedness of which it was too often the mask; here, there,
and everywhere in place-names which no waves of
changeful times have ever been able to efface; here in the quaint
nomenclature of cottage flowers; here in the lingering
belief in homely simples and cures; in tradition, in
legend, in song, in proverbial expression• in holy wells
and holy trees and holy hills, and in a hundred other
shapes which bring a mighty past forcibly before the most
unimaginative of minds.


Meanwhile the Reformation was proceeding. It is
foreign to the particular object of this work to deal in
detail with this tremendous event, but we can hardly pass
it by unnoticed. Briefly, therefore, its causes were :  
  
  
  1.—The revival of learning caused by the invention of  
  
  
  printing.  
  
  
  2.—The sale of indulgences by the Papacy, against  
  
  
  wliich Luther so particularly set himself.  
  
  
  Its progress may be summed up :—  
  
  
  1.—The Pope by thwarting Henry in the matter of  
  
  
  the divorce of Catharine of Arragon drove the
King to be a Protestant, although he was  
  
  
  essentially a Romanist.  
  
  
  2.—The Act of Supremacy, 1534, which transferred  
  
  
  the headship of the church from the Pope to  
  
  
  the King.  
  
  
  3.—The dissolution of the monasteries.
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 153 -->
  
  4.—The temporary check given to its progress by the  
  
  
  Law of the Six Articles, which were distinctly  
  
  
  un-Protestant.  
  
  
  5.—The Reformation emphasised by the Act of  
  
  
  Uniformity.


We are now at liberty to turn to the general history of
this reign in its particular association with the county of
Kent.


Henry was particularly partial to Greenwich Palace, and
a few descriptions of the magnificent festivities there may
be interesting.


The Christmas of 1513 was kept at Greenwich, and Hall
thus describes the Twelfth Night festivities :


\"According to olde custom there came into the greate
hall a mount called the riche mount. This mount was set
full of riche flowers of silk, and especially of brome
slippes full of poddes, the branches were greene satin,
and the flowers flat gold of damaske, which signified
Plantagenet* on the top stood a goodly bekon giving light,
rounde above the bekon sat the King and five other, al in
coates and cappes of right crimosin velvet, embroidered
with flat gold of damaske, their coats set full of spangells
of gold; and foure woodhouses drew the mount till it came
before the Queen, and then the King and his compaigne
descended and daunced; then suddainly the mount opened
and out came six ladies all in crimosin sattin and plunket,
embroudered with golde and perle, with French hoodes on
their heddes, and they daunced alone. Then the lordes of
the mount took the ladies and daunced together, and the
ladies re-entered, and the mount closed, and so was
conveyed out of the hall."


In 1515 there was a picturesque observance of the old
English May Day festival on Shooter's Hill.  
  
  
  Miss Strickland thus describes it :


\"Catharine and the royal bride (Mary, Henry's sister,
who had married Louis XII. of France) rode a maying
with the King from the Palace of Greenwich to Shooter's
Hill. Here the archers of the King's -guard met them
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 154 -->
dressed like Robin Hood and his outlaws, and begged that
the royal party would enter the good green wood and see
how outlaws lived.


\"On this Henry, turning to the Queen, asked her if she
and her damsels would venture into the thicket with so
many outlaws.


"Catharine replied that where he went she was content
to go. The K ing then handed her to a sylvan bower, formed
of hawthorn boughs, spring flowers and moss, with
apartments joining, where was laid out a breakfast of venison.
The Queen partook of the feast and was greatly delighted
with this lodge in the wilderness. AATien she returned
towards Greenwich with the King they met on the road
a flowery car, drawn by five horses; each was ridden by
a fair damsel. The ladies and their steeds personated the
attributes of the Spring. The horses had their names
lettered on their head gear, and the damsels had theirs on
their dresses. The first steed was Caude, or Heat, on
him sat the lady Humid; the second was Memeon, on
which rode the lady Vert or Verdure * on the third,
Phæton, was the lady Vegitive; on the steed, Rimphon,
sat the lady Plesaunce * on the fifth, Lampace, sat lady
Sweet Odour. In the car was the Lady May, attended by
Flora. All these damsels burst into sweet song when they
met the Queen at the foot of Shooter's Hill, and preceded
the royal party carolling hymns to the May, till they
reached Greenwich Palace."


The amusements of the day concluded with the King and
the Duke of Suffolk riding races on great Flemish
coursers—said to be the first mention of horse racing in
English history.


In 1518 a play was exhibited in the great hall at
Greenwich.


\"A rock ful of al maner of stones very artificially
made, and on the top stood five trees : the first was an
olive tree, on which hung a shielde of the armes of Rome;
the second was a pyneaple tree, with the armes of the
Emperor; the third was a rosyer, with the armes of

England; the fourthe a braunche of lylies, bearing the
armes of France; and the fifth a pomegranet tree, bearing
the armes of Spain; in token that all these five potentates
were joined together in one league against the enemies of
Christ's fayth : in and upon the middles of the rock satte
a fayre lady, richly appareyled, with a dolphin in her lap.
In this rock were ladies and gentlemen appareyled in
crimosyn sattin, covered over with floures of purple sattin,
embroidered with wrethes of gold knit together with
golden laces, and on every floure a hart of gold moving.
The ladies tyer (head dress) was after the fashion of Inde,
with kerchiefs of pleasaunce hacked with fine gold, and
sett with letters of Greeke in gold of bullion, and the
edges of their kerchiefs were garnished with hanging
perle. These gentlemen and ladyes sate on the neyther
part of the rock, and out of a cave in the same rock came
ten knightes armed at all poyntes, and faughte together a
fayre tournay. And when they were severed and
departed, the disguysers dissended from the rock and
daunced a great space, and sodeynly the rock moved and
receaved the disguysers and immediately closed agayn.
Then entred a person called Report, appareled in crymosyn
sattin, full of tongues, sitting on a flying horse with
wynges and feete of gold called Pegasus; this person in
Frenche declared the meaning of the rock, the trees and
the tournay."


In 1520 was enacted the famous pageant of the Field
of the Cloth of Gold. Henry travelled from Greenwich
to Otford, Leeds, Charing and Canterbury, stopping at the
Archbishop's manor houses in these places at a tremendous
cost to their owners. From Canterbury the King rode
towards Dover to meet his nephew, afterwards the
Emperor Charles V, but the latter had had a bad Channel
crossing and was lying prostrate in Dover Castle.


The King's suite on this occasion consisted of over
4,000 people and 1,700 horses, and he travelled very
heavily. With him he took a " house" of timber in
fourteen waggons, a tent of cloth of gold, besides others;
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 156 -->
an army of cooks and attendants, an enormous wardrobe,
and the complete choir of his Chapel Royal, 115 in
number.


The uniform of English troops seems to have been first
settled on this occasion. It consisted of a blue coat picked
out with red, one stocking red, the other blue, and the
latter with a three-inch red stripe along the seam.


In 1525 the King, or rather AVolsey, in order to meet
the cost of a war in alliance with Charles V. against
France, attempted to demand a levy of a sixth of every
man's substance, payable in money, plate, or jewels,
according to the last valuation. The Commissioners
appointed to collect it were driven out of Kent, and the
people absolutely refused to pay, declaring that the taxes
of England were becoming worse than those of France,
and that the last loan they granted had never been
repaid.


Moreover they pleaded poverty; the clothiers of
Romney Marsh complained bitterly of business, and
AVarham was much ridiculed for urging that Kent should
meet the demand willingly inasmuch as the King was a
Kent man. So strong indeed was the feeling amongst the
clothiers of the Cranbrook and Goudhurst districts that at
one time affairs seemed to point to a rising. At any rate
it was probably the determined resistance of the loan in
Kent, coupled with the issue of the battle of Pavia, by
which the power of France was crushed, that it failed.


In 1527, on the occasion of the reception of the French
ambassadors, a play was acted before them by the boys of
St. Paul's School at Greenwich. Hall describes the play,
but on the chance that a repetition of such ceremonies
may prove wearisome, we omit it. Mr. Froude's
addendum, however, in the shape of a list of the costumes is too
characteristic not to be given. The characters were:  
  
  
  An orator in apparel of cloth of gold.  
  
  
  Religio, Ecclesia, Veritas, like three widows, in
gar
ments of silk, and suits of lawn and cypress.
Heresy and False Interpretation, like sisters of

Bohemia, apparelled in silk of divers colours.
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 157 -->
  
  The heretic Luther, like a party friar, in russet

damask and black taffety.  
  
  
  Luther's wife, like a frow of Spiers in Almayn, in red

silk.  
  
  
  Peter, Paul, and James, in habits of white sarsnet,

and three red mantles, and lace of silver and

damask, and pelisses of scarlet.  
  
  
  A cardinal in his apparel.
Two sergeants in rich apparel.  
  
  
  The Dolphin and his brother in coats of velvet
em
broidered with gold, and capes of satin bound

with velvet.  
  
  
  A messenger in tinsel satin.  
  
  
  Six men in gowns of grey sarsnet.
Six women in gowns of crimson velvet.
War, in rich cloth of gold and feathers, armed.
Three Almeyns in apparel all cut and holed in silk.
Lady Peace in lady's apparel white and rich.
Lady Quietness and Dame Tranquility richly beseen  
  
  
  in lady's apparel.


It was at this entertainment that the little Princess
Mary, afterwards Queen, danced with five of her
companions dressed as Icelanders with six similarly clad
gentlemen.


About this time Henry first cast eyes on Anne Boleyn,
who was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catharine, and,
hearing that young lord Percy, also in the Household,
was a suitor for her hand, he caused her to be removed,
and she returned to her father's house at Hever.


For this she blamed AA'olsey, nor did she ever after cease
to work against him.


Sir Thomas AVyatt of Abington was another of her
admirers, but prudently he kept quiet when he saw that the
king was on the path, and consoled himself with these lines:  
  
  
  " Who list to hunt, I put him out of doubt,
As well as I, may spend his time in vain !
Graven with diamonds in letters plain,
There is written her fair neck about,
Noli me tangere ! For Cæsar's I am,
Aud wild for to hold, though I seem tame."
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 158 -->

The Christmas of 1527 was celebrated with much pomp
at Greenwich. The " sweating sickness " was raging now
virulently about the Court and neighbouring county, and
Anne was seized with it. Henry paid her marked
attentions at He ver, riding over from Greenwich almost daily,
and is said to have given notice of his approach by
sounding a horn from "King Harry's Hill." There is a
\"Mount Harry" at Sevenoaks, but no Elizabethan horn
blown into even by the robust lungs of a Bluff King Hal
could possibly have been heard from here at Hever. (See
Note C at the end of Tudor Kent).


In 152S Anne Boleyn was with the King at Greenwich
for Christmas, although Queen Catharine was still at
Court, and much comment was provoked thereby. Feeling
her power, Anne began to use it. She interceded for Sir
Thomas Cheney, Lord AA*arden, whom AA'olsey had driven
from Court, and devoted herself to schemes against the
Cardinal with such success that it was considered his fall
was greatly due to her. In 1529 Anne Boleyn kept a
rival Court at Christmas to the Queen. Then came the
separation from the Papacy—Cromwell's work; the King
sends an ultimatum to the Queen, which she rejects and
quits Greenwich accompanied by Thomas Abell, her
chaplain and confessor, who, however, to her great sorrow
was shortly removed from her.


Anne Boleyn was now continually in the King's
company. In 1532 she was made Marchioness of
Pembroke, and was virtually Mistress of the Court: she
accompanied the King to Canterbury, Dover, and Calais,
and was present at his interview with Francis I.


She was about this time secretly married to Henry,
whether at Blickling in Norfolk, or at Dover, or at
Whitehall, is not certain. In 1533 the ceremony was openly
solemnised, and the next year she was crowned Queen, at
whieh ceremony her quondam lover Sir Thomas Wyatl,
holding the position of Chief Ewerer, had to perform the
duty of pouring scented water over her hands.  
  
  
  In 1533, to the immeasurable disgust of the King, a
<!-- Leaf 201 -->
  
  HEVER. CASTLE
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P201_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 159 -->
daughter, afterwards the renowned Queen Elizabeth,
was born at Greenwich. Henry never got over this
disappointment, and three years later his susceptible
heart was smitten by the charms of Jane Seymour, and
in consequence of this semi-detached state of affairs Anne
led a sad, neglected life at Greenwich, finding her pastime
in laying out the Park after the model of her beloved
Blickling, operations still visible in the stately avenues
of Spanish chestnuts.


Henry was now keenly on the watch for a valid excuse
to get rid of Anne, and the opportunity occurred at a
tournament held at Greenwich where Anne coquetted with
Norris. The trial and execution of Anne followed in due
course, and on the morning after, Henry became the
husband of Jane Seymour. This was in 1536.


The winter of 1536-7 was so severe that the Thames at
Greenwich was frozen sufficiently thick to be crossed on
horseback.


In the spring of 1537 the King went to Canterbury to
see that the destruction of Becket's shrine had been
thoroughly effected, and possessed himself of the famous
ring offered by Louis JX. called the Regale of France.


In 1539 the threatening aspect of the Continental
sovereigns consequent upon Henry's defiance of the Papal
power compelled him to put the southern counties in a
thorough state of defence, and he personally made a tour
of inspection of the musters and beacons of the county of
Kent.  
  
  
  Lambarde says :


\"Of this I hold me well assured that King Henry viii,
having shaken off the intolerable yoke of the Papal
tyranny, and espying that the Emperor was offended by
the divorce of Catharine his wife, and that the French
King had coupled the Dolphine, his son, to the Pope's
niece, and married his daughter to the King of Scots,
determined to stand upon his own guard and defence, and
without sparing any cost he builded castles, platforms, and
block houses in all needful parts of the Kindgom, and
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 160 -->
erected near together three fortifications which might at
all times keep and beat the landing place, viz : Sandown,
Deal, and AValmer."


Marillac, the French Ambassador, in passing Dover saw
new ramparts and bulwarks on the rock where the sea
beats, and well pierced with great and small artillery. At
Canterbury and other places he saw them making musters
of all subjects who can bear arms, enrolling all over
seventeen or eighteen years of age, without excepting the
aged. He met on the road a band of men going into
garrison upon the Dane, who said they would be from five
to six thousand men, " in short, they have gone so far
that whatever hurt come they could not be taken
unprepared."


In 1539 Jane Seymour died, and Thomas Culpeper,
one of the King's train, went over to Calais to meet Anne
of Cleves, who, on the strength of flattering portraiture,
had been recommended to Henry as a successor.


Anne arrived at Deal on December 27th, and was
lodged in the new AA'almer Castle, whence the gentry of
Kent escorted her to Dover Castle. From Dover she
went to Canterbury, being met on Barham Downs by
Cranmer, five bishops, and the local clergy and gentry,
who accompanied her to St. Augustine's. It was very
foul weather when Anne arrived at Canterbury. She was
received by torchlight with a great peal of bells, and was
presented by Cromwell with fifty " sufferans," to which
the City of Canterbury added fifty angels. The next
day she went to Ospringe, where she slept at Maison
Dieu, then to Rainham, where she was met by the gentry
of Norfolk and Suffolk, and then to Rochester, where she
stayed at the Bishop's Palace until New Year's Day.


On New Year's Eve, Henry, who lodged at the Crown
Inn at Rochester (where part of the original stable in
which took place the Carrier's Scene in Shakespeare's
Henry the Fourth stood until quite recently), came to
have a peep incognito at his intended bride, together
with eight gentlemen of his Privy Chamber "all dressed
alike in coats of marble colour."
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 161 -->

Sir Antony Browne, who brought Anne a New Year's
gift, says he was struck with consternation when he
was shown the Queen, and was never so dismayed in
his life as to see a lady so far unlike what was
represented. The King " recoiled in bitter disappointment,"
called her "a Flanders mare," and Lord Russell says
\"That he never saw his Royal Highness so marvellously
astonished and abashed as on that occasion."


She too was not more charmed at the great, bloated
being who was to be her lord and master, but there
was nothing to be done on either side but to grin and
bear, and so the King dissembled admirably and received
her graciously. But he returned to Greenwich in a very
melancholy mood and began to revolve schemes by which
he could get out of his engagement. Anne went on to
Dartford.


The first public meeting of the King and Anne of
Cleves took place on Blackheath. It was a gorgeous
pageant, for details of which we may refer the reader
to Hall's Chronicle, but it is interesting to note that
the exact meeting place of the King and his bride was
at that tumulus known as "Jack Cade's Mound," but
formerly called after the cross which stood there until
the time of Charles II.


The pageant passed across the Heath and through the
Park to the Palace, and here on Twelfth Night the
marriage was celebrated.


Henry never conquered his repugnance to Anne, and
pretty severely he made those suffer who had so
misrepresented her as to induce him to betroth himself to
her, the fall of Cromwell in particular being* directly
attributable to the part he had taken.


After a great deal of consultation and legal
hair-spliting the following grounds were considered valid enough
for a divorce :  
  
  
  1.—Anne was pre-contracted to the Prince of  
  
  
  Lorraine.  
  
  
  2.—In marrying her against his will Henry could not  
  
  
  be considered as having consented.  
  
  
  M
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 162 -->

In July, 1540, the divorce was pronounced; Cromwell
and Barnes, the chief agents in the marriage negotiations,
were executed, and Anne was sent off to Place House,
Dartford, a remnant of the once famous Augustinian
nunnery for noble Kentish ladies, remains of which still
exist.


Very shortly afterwards the King married Catherine
Howard, who on her mother's side was a Culpeper of
Hollingbourne, and had been a maid of honour to Anne
of Cleves.


The Royal pair spent much of their time at Greenwich
and Eltham, but Catherine was a flighty lady, and being
suspected of undue intimacy with her cousin, Sir John
Culpeper, he was executed first and in 1542 she shared the
same fate.


In 1544 Henry was present at the siege of Boulogne,
and on his return stayed at Upper Hardres, the residence
of Sir Thomas Hardres, who had accompanied his royal
master to the picnic, and in token thereof was presented
by Henry with the gates of the captured town and with
his own dagger.


Both of these curiosities were shown for a long* time
after, but at the beginning of the present century the
gates were actually sold for the price of the iron in them.


In 1545 England, which had made no progress in the
science of war since the accession of Henry VIL, who was
essentially a pacific monarch, was thoroughly alarmed and
awakened by fears of foreign invasion, and even the
Archbishop of Canterbury asked for artillery for the
cliffs. The days of archery were past, and our fleet at the
accession of Henry VIII. consisted of 30 men-of-war,
averaging 150 tons, and one of 1,000 tons. For the first
time in our history the nation was provided with a navy
worthy of the name, and an origin of our national anthem
words may perhaps be found in the challenge and answer
of this time, the former being " God save the King " and
the latter, " Long to reign over us."  
  
  
  At this time the population of England was about
<!-- Leaf 207, Page: 163 -->
4,000,000, whilst that of France was 14,000,000, and of
the Spanish Empire 16,000,000. The population of
London and its suburbs was about 130,000, whilst Paris
numbered more than 400,000, and even Milan and Ghent
250,000. Our trade was chiefly in the hands of foreigners,
and the commerce of the world was carried in Hanseatic,
Venetian, Spanish, Flemish and French ships. The
revenue of Venice was even greater than that of England,
which was about £125,000, whilst that of France was
£800,000, and of Spain £1,100,000. AVe give these
details in order to accentuate the boldness of the step
taken by Henry in practically defying Christendom by
his throwing off the Papal supremacy, and to afford some
estimate of the tremendous odds against England in the
event of an European combination to crush her.


The French were very lively in their aggression. They
landed on the Isle of Wight, but were handsomely
repulsed, and repeating the experiment at Seaford met with
the same fate. It was during this scare that the Mary
Rose went down in Portsmouth Harbour with three
hundred men.


A "benevolence" was levied in this year, but no one was
called upon to contribute whose lands were of less value
than forty shillings, or whose chattels were less than
fifteen pounds. Perhaps we may get an idea of the
comparative standings of the counties by the results of
this levy, although we must remember that the Cinque
Ports, their limbs and members, were absolved by the
character of their peculiar services from being called upon.
Thus we find Kent returned for £6,471, Suffolk £4,512,
Norfolk £4,046, Somerset £6,800 and Lancashire only
£660.

There is not much connected with Kent to detain us
during this reign.


The Kent men showed themselves no more disposed than
did the Londoners to back up Northumberland in his
violent scheme of placing the innocent Lady Jane Grey—■
of whom it was written :  
  
  
  " Girl never breathed to rival such a rose,
Rose never blew that equall'd such a bud :—'

great grand-daughter of Henry ATI., who had married
Northumberland's son, Lord Guides ord Dudley of Halden,
on the throne upon the death of the King to the exclusion
of the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth, although
Northumberland, with the history of the past before him, had no
doubt counted upon the county.


The murder of Arden of Faversham—or Feversham as
it was called and is still written on some mile stones—
whieh occurred in this reign, is interesting as being the
theme of one of the earliest examples of English domestic
drama in blank verse. So late as 1770 the Tragedy of
Arden of Feversham, or to give it the full title: "The
Lamentable and True Tragedy of Mr. Arden of Feversham
who was most wickedly murdered by the means of his
wanton and disloyal wife, who, for the love she bore to
one Mosbie, hired two desperate ruffians, Black AA'ill and
Shagbag, to kill him," was attributed to Shakespeare, the
grounds of supposition being that the story is fully told by
Holinshed upon whom Shakespeare drew largely for his
facts, that Arden was the name of Shakespeare's mother,
and that, shortly after the murder, the Earl of Leicester's
players, whose London home was the Blackfriars theatre,
happened to be at Faversham.
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 165 -->

Edward lived much of his short, sickly life at Greenwich.
Early in 1552 he was stricken here with measles and
smallpox, and records "I was sick, and not able to go abroad;
so I signed a bill containing the names of the Acts I would
have passed."


At Greenwich he was visited by a celebrated Milanese
doctor, Cardonao, who speaks of him thus highly :


\"You may know the lion by his paw. His ingenuous
nature and sweet conditions rendered him great in the
expectations of all, whether good or learned men. He began
to savour learning before he could know it, and he knew it
before he knew what use to make of it. Oh, how true is
the saying, ' Precocious grow*ths are short-lived, and rarely
arrive at maturity !' This prince could give you a taste of
his virtues, not an example. He was stored with graces,
for, being yet a child, he spake many languages, his native
English, Latin, French, and Spanish. He wanted neither
the rudiments of logic, the principles of philosophy, nor
music. He was full of humanity, had the highest sense of
morality, and displayed the gravity befitting royalty of
hopes like his. A child of so great wit and promise could
not be born without a kind of miracle of nature."


The story was long popular that after the young king's
removal as an invalid from AA'hitehall, whither he had gone
during a temporary rally, to Greenwich, his medical
attendants were sent away and a quack nurse substituted,
who hastened his end. It was also said that his body lay
unburied at Greenwich during the short reign of Lady
Jane Grey, and quite recently the discovery at AA*indsor of
a coffin enclosing the remains of a youth evidently of
distinction has re-awakened the belief that by the
machinations of his sister Mary he had been poisoned, and
hastily and secretly buried. But the detailed accounts
extant of his last illness and of his funeral in AVestuiinster
Abbey would seem to disprove these legends.  
  
  
  Mary. 1553-1558.


Mary Tudor, who was born at Greenwich, was hailed
Queen by the almost universal suffrage of the nation, and
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 166 -->
it became very soon evident that she was bent upon the
reestablishment of the old religion from which she had never
recanted. AA'holesale ejectments of bishops took place,
and Cranmer, foreseeing the storm, sought to evade it by
retiring* first to Bekesbourne and then to Ford, but from
here he was summoned to London and committed to the
Tower.


Mary made no secret of her designs, which were indeed
encouraged by almost the whole country except the City
of London. For instance, although thc funeral of Edward
VI. was solemnized according to the ritual of the Church
of England, the Queen at the same time held a Requiem
Mass in the chapel of the Tower. Finally the question of
her marriage with Philip the Second of Spain was brought
forward. At once the scare of a Spanish Alliance filled
the minds even of Roman Catholics with intense dread;
and ominous murmurings were heard at the prospect of an
union between two monarchs to whom, to quote Mr.
Motley, " The maintenance of the supremacy of the church
seemed the main object of existence; to execute
unbelievers, the most sacred duty imposed by the Deity upon
anointed princes; to convert their kingdoms into a hell,
the surest means of winning Heaven for themselves."


The outcome of this feeling in our county was the
rebellion of Sir Thomas AA'yatt, son of the lover of Anne
Boleyn.


He undertook to raise Kent, whilst the Midlands and
the AVestern Counties were to act simultaneously, all the
movements converging on London.


On January 22nd, 1554, fifteen hundred men assembled
at Allington Castle, whilst five thousand more held
themselves ready when called upon in their homes. Rochester
Castle was fixed upon as the head quarters, Sir George
Harper of Sutton Valence was elected joint commander, a
squadron in the Thames promised support, Rochester
Bridge was covered by artillery, and the armoury at
Penshurst was rifled during the absence at Court of Sir Henry
Sidney.
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 167 -->

AA*yatt caused the following proclamation to be
published at Tunbridge, Sevenoaks, Ashford and Maidstone :—
\"Forasmuche as it is now sprede abrode and certainly
pronounced by the Lorde Chancelour and other of the
Councel, of the Queene's determinate pleasure to marry
with a stranger. AVe therefore write unto you, because ye
be our neyghbours, because ye bee our frendes, and
because ye bee Englishmen, that ye wyll joyne with us as
we wil with you unto death in this behalfe, protesting
unto you before God that no other earthly cause could
move us unto this enterprise but this alone, wherein we
seeke no harme to the Queene but better counsel and
counselours, which also we would have foreborne in al
other matters, saving only in this. For herin lieth the
lielth and welth of us al. For trial herof and manifest
proof of this intended purpose, lo now even at hand
Spaniards be nowe alreadye arrived at Dover at one
passage to the nombre of an hundreth passing upwarde to
London in companies of ten, foure, and VL, with harnes,
harquebuses, and morians, with match light, the foremoste
company whereof be alreadie at Rochester. AVe shall
therefore require you to repaire to such places as the
bearers hereof shall pronounce unto you, there to assemble
and determine what may be best for th advauncement of
libertie and commonwealth in this behalfe, and to bring
with you such ayde as you maye."


A most practical and common-place address compared
with that which Tennyson has put into the mouth of
Wyatt, in " Queen Mary," commencing " Men of Kent !
England of England ! "


Canterbury remained loyal, as did Lord Abergavenny
and Sir Robert Southwell, Sheriff of Kent, who were at
once proclaimed traitors by Wyatt, but the mass of Kent
men were for AA*yatt.


The Sheriff and Lord Abergavenny assembled a force at
Mailing, and at once marched on Rochester to intercept the
men of the Weald coming to reinforce Wyatt, and near
Wrotham Hill came up with them. On Blacksole Field
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 168 -->
there was a fight, of which the rebels got the worst, but at
the moment of victory a large party of loyalists deserted
to AVyatt's standard.


The Commons of Kent, " the same violent and
inflammable people whom John Cade had a century before
led to London," as Froude calls them, swarmed in to join
AVyatt from all sides, and for the moment things looked
black for the royal cause.


Mary, however, was equal to the occasion : she made an
impassioned harangue to the Londoners—to the people, be
it noted, of that city which was distinguished almost from
the rest of England by its sturdy Protestantism—obtained
the promise of 500 men, and as a preliminary sent an offer
of pardon to all rebels who should lay down their arms.
The offer was rejected, whereupon the Duke of Norfolk
advanced to attack Rochester.


The action was on the point of commencing when a shout
of "Treason" was heard, and the whole, of the London
"whitecoats" crossed over and joined the ranks of
AVyatt.


This was a severe blow to the Royal cause at the very
onset, and, had not the Western rising under Carew failed
at this time, the course of history might have been
materially changed.


Wyatt now determined to march on London, but, to
secure Lord Cobham who was shut up in his castle at
Cowling, hesitating what course to adopt, he turned aside
aud stormed the castle with 2,000 men, whereupon Cobham
surrendered it, and Lord Abergavenny and the Sheriff,
whose men were deserting wholesale, fled to the Court.


London, however, remained true to the Queen, and
prepared to receive the rebels.


These marched by Gravesend and Dartford, numbering
about 12,000 men, and arrived in Southwark, February
3rd, 1554.


They found the drawbridge cut away, the gates of
London Bridge barred, and Lord Howard ready for them
with four guns. The next night, however, the Lieutenant
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 169 -->
of the Tower trained seven guns to bear upon the steeple
of St. Mary Overies and St. Olave's, whereupon the people
of Southwark beseeched AA*yatt to withdraw, and he
magnanimously agreed to. The rebels seem to have
behaved very well during their sojourn in Southwark,
the only act of violence recorded against them being the
burning of Winchester House and the destruction of its
contents.


Wyatt quitted Southwark with the object of crossing
the river at Kingston Bridge, but already the heart of the
insurgents seems to have been broken, for he marched with
only 1,500 men.


At Kingston he found the bridge broken. The repair
occasioned some delay, but the river was crossed and the
march Londonwards along the other bank resumed on bad
roads in bad weather. AVyatt's followers were becoming
more and more dispirited; the Rochester men left him,
and only the London men with Sir George Harper, Antony
Knevett, and Lord Cobham's sons remained.


AVyatt's object was to enter the city by Ludgate, which
was to be opened to him by friends within, but the scheme
reached the ears of the Royal chiefs, and Ludgate was
strongly manned.


At Knightsbridge, where was a stream and much marshy
land which so seriously incommoded the rebels that they
were dubbed " Draggletails," AVyatt halted his wearied
men. The next morning he reached Hyde Park Corner,
where he was fired on by a battery on Hay Hill, and
further on a manœuvre of the Royal Cavalry cut him off
from some 300 of his men. He pushed on, however, along
Pall Mall, Charing Cross, and the Strand, fighting pretty
stiffly all the way, descended Fleet Street, and arrived at
Ludgate only to have it shut in his face. By this time he
had but twenty-four men left, and, thoroughly sick at
heart, he sat down at a stall opposite the Belle Sauvage
Inn, and surrendered himself to Sir Maurice Berkeley, and
the ill-timed attempt was at an end.  
  
  
  Then came the retribution. Fifty deserter citizens who
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 170 -->
had fled were hung at their own doors. Stow gives the
numbers executed at eighty men in London and twenty two
in Kent. The two Isleys were executed at Maidstone, the
two Knevetts at Sevenoaks, Brett at Rochester, the Duke
of Suffolk and his two brothers, whilst the Cobhams got
off by laying their heads on the block. Lord Guldeford
Dudley and Lady Jane Grey were executed on Tower Hill,
and in April AVyatt suffered at the same place. Under
examination, that is, the rack, it is probable that he said
something to incriminate the Princess Elizabeth, but on
the scaffold he stoutly denied that she had any hand in
the matter.


Long after this event Kentish boys played at " Queen's
Men" and "Wyatt's Men," just as Somersetshire boys
more than a century later played at " Monmouth's Men "
and " King's Men " after Sedgemoor.


Maidstone was disenfranchised for the share she had
taken in Wyatt's rebellion. Kent indeed was hasty : if
she had waited a little the South AVest, the Midland, and
Wales would have joined cause with her, and the result
might have been that the Princess Elizabeth would have
ascended the throne.


The Marian persecution of the Protestants, wliich
followed closely upon the Queen's marriage with the King
of Spain, affected Kent more severely than any other part
of England except the diocese of London.


Between January, 1554, and November, 1558,
thirtyeight men and sixteen women were executed in the county,
a goodly proportion of the estimated number of victims
altogether, which is fixed at between three and four
hundred. Canterbury was naturally the head centre of
persecution, but Ashford and AVye each claimed two
victims. (See Note D at the end of Tudor Kent). The first
female martyr in England was Margaret Policy, who was
burned at Tunbridge, and the last victims of the
persecution were three men and two women who were burned
at Canterbury, November, 1558.  
  
  
  It is difficult to arrive at a real estimate of Mary's share
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 171 -->
in these horrors. Had she been less devoted to her fanatic
husband there is sufficient evidence in the character of the
legislature of her reign to justify us that much of the
reputation she enjoys is undeserved. Possibly she may
be regarded as a scapegoat, the real offenders being
Gardiner, Reginald Pole, Bonner, and the Parliament
acting under the influence of the King.


During the period of the persecution she was in a
miserable state of health, which prevented her from
exercising her woman's prerogative of mercy. Her Court
was pure and frugal. Many of her laws were manifestly
ahead of her times, notably that which directed that judges
should take the examination of felons in writing. The gaols
were in a respectable state : the poor were bountifully
relieved, as is shown by the absence of insurrections during
a period when corn was at a famine price. Very few
monasteries were re-established, and the " benefit of the
clergy " was abolished, by which the ancient law that the
Church could claim jurisdiction over all civil criminals
who could read was rendered null and void. She kept her
word that no alterations should be made in the national
religion without general consent; she had no
standingarmy to overawe Parliaments and no rich civil list to
bribe them. On the whole, therefore, Mary's most virulent
detractors are inclined to class the acts for which she was
personally held responsible as those of a woman deranged
in mind. The strange combination of characteristics in
Mary's personality is thus set forth by Motley :


\"Small, lean and sickly, painfully near-sighted, yet with
an eye of fierceness and fire; her face wrinkled by care
and evil passion still more than by time; with a big man's
voice, whose harshness made those in the next room
tremble; yet feminine in her tastes, skilful with her
needle, fond of embroidery work, striking the lute with a
touch remarkable for its science and feeling; speaking
many languages, including Latin, with fluency and grace •
most feminine, too, in her constitutional sufferings,
hysterical of habit, shedding floods of tears daily at
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 172 -->
Philip's coldness, undisguised infidelity, and frequent
absences from England—she almost awakens compassion,
and causes a momentary oblivion of her identity."


The last year of Mary's reign was a black one in the
annals of England. The people were sickened with the
persecutions, wearied by the continual wars with Scotland
and France; the empty Treasury had to be filled by a
forced loan, and, to cap all, Calais, " the brightest jewel
in the English crown," the last remnant of our
Plantagenet conquests, the sturdily held fortress over the gate
of wliich was inscribed  
  
  
  " Then shall Frenchmen Calais win,

When iron and lead like cork shall swim;

was torn from our grasp in fair fight by the French. It
may be noted that Calais sent two representatives to
Parliament.


This roused the nation to one of its feveiish fits of
warlike preparation. An ordinance was put forth by which
every peer, knight, or gentleman with an income above
£1,000 a year, was to furnish sixteen horses with steel
harness, forty corslets, coats of mail, and morions, thirty long
bows with arrows, and as many steel caps, halberds, black
bills and haquebuts, and so on in a descending scale. All
able-bodied men between the years of sixteen and sixty
were to be held ready for service, and the muster roll of
each county* was to be presented.


It was, however, but a flash in the pan. The people
were dispirited : in many counties, Kent amongst them,
the ordinance was simply ignored, and no muster returns
made, and then, happily for everybody, the unhappy Queen
died, and the Princess Elizabeth ascended the throne.  
  
  
  Elizabeth. 1558-1603.


On the accession of Elizabeth, as we have seen, England
was in a bad condition, and the fate of the nation
nowdepended, perhaps more than at any other period of its
history, upon the personal character of its sovereign; and,
as Elizabeth, despite occasional outbursts of Tudor self
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 173 -->
will and imperiousness, had been little known to the
English people except as a scholarly and somewhat crushed
recluse, it may be imagined that at a crisis when strong,
vigorous action on the part of the Head of the State was
required some anxiety should be felt as to the issue of
events.


How the personal character of Elizabeth the Queen was
an important factor in the glory of her reign is, of course,
now a matter of history.


Elizabeth was born at Greenwich, in the room known
from its tapestry hangings as the Chamber of the Virgins,
she was christened at the Convent of the Grey Friars, and
throughout her reign preferred Greenwich to any other of
her palaces, not excepting Windsor, so that she was
essentially more Kentish a Queen than even the wife of
Ethelbert. As Miss Strickland says :


\"Every dell and hill about Greenwich and Blackheath
is classic ground, trod by the footsteps of England's
Elizabeth—scenes where she walked, and meditated, and
resolved her great measures for the public weal, or
matured the little household plots which agitated the under
current of her domestic history." And again she quotes
from Rowland AVhyte, " The queen at Greenwich uses to
walk much in the park, and takes great walks out of the
park, and round about the park."


Outside the grand old park, however, wholesale
jerrybuilding has knocked on the head all the Elizabethan
romance about Greenwich and Blackheath, and the most
vivid imagination requires painful stretching to picture
the neighbourhood as it was in the days of Gloriana. As
regards our county especially during this reign, the interest
centres around the development of her industries and the
part she played in the great Drama of the Armada.


In 1561, Sandwich, a fast decaying port owing to the
silting up of her harbour, was authorised to receive some
five-and-twenty master workers in baize and flannels from
the Netherlands, where the tyranny of Alva and his
lieutenants, and the operation of the Inquisition, were
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 174 -->
sapping the very heart of national life. These immigrants
also brought with them the knowledge of other useful arts,
such as the manufacture of paper and the cultivation of
flowers and vegetables, and their memory is still preserved
in such names as Dels Street, and of the surrounding
marshes, which are called " The Polders."


In 1567 Maidstone petitioned and was allowed to
receive weavers of linen thread, whose peculiar work was
long after known as " Dutch." In the same year French
Protestant refugees settled in Canterbury and established
there a silk weaving industry. For many years they set
up their looms in the crypt of the Cathedral, and
adjoining their workshops was their place of worship, wliich
still exists, although lately it has been much altered, and
is used by their descendants, good Englishmen all of
them, but bearing their French names or the same oddly
anglicised. The industry has now gone to Spitalfields in
London, but so late as 1789 the silk for the decoration
of the Prince of AVales's palatial Carlton House was
from the Canterbury looms. These Huguenots also made
lustreings, brocades, satins, paduasoys, black and coloured
velvets, cutlery, instruments, hardware and toys.


During the reign of Elizabeth no less than forty-six
statutes were passed for the regulation of the woollen
trade. In 1576 a further impulse was given to it by the
sacking of Antwerp, whereby the Antwerp trade came to
England.


To a limited extent the AYealdeii iron trade flourished
in Kent during this reign, but not nearly as much as
that of Sussex. There were forges at Cranbrook,
Hawkhurst, Goudhurst, Horsmonden, Cowden, Tunbridge,
Biddenden, Ashurst and Laruberhurst. In 1573 there
were 10 owners, 6 forges and 8 furnaces in the Weald of
Kent, as against 42 owners, 40 forges and 32 furnaces in
Sussex.


Considerable alarm, however, about the consumption of
timber for fuel, which meant the diminution of the supply
of timber for the other great Kentish industry,
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 175 -->
shipbuilding, brought about severe ordinances restricting the
felling of timber for the iron manufacture, and limiting
its exercise to certain places. Cannon were founded in
large quantities, and even exported for the use of foreign
Governments, and the discovery of this caused the
passing of an ordinance by which no piece of cannon could
be cast without a licence. Another evil resulting directly
from the iron industry was the destruction of high roads
wrought by the constant transport of timber, which was
usually done in winter when the roads were naturally at
their worst. To remedy this an Act was passed by which
it was forbidden to use the roads for this purpose between
October 12th and May 1st.


Queen Elizabeth, like her predecessors, always kept the
old national festival on St. George's Day, which we modern
Englishmen have unaccountably allowed to be utterly
overlooked and forgotten. In the year 1561 it was
celebrated with much circumstance at Greenwich, and a
short description of it from Sir Henry Nicolas's History of
the Order of the Garter may not be out of place.


\"All her Majesty's chapel came through the hall in
copes, to the number of thirty, singing ' O God, the
Father of Heaven,' the outward court to the gate being
strewed with green rushes. After came Mr. Garter, and
Mr. Norroy, and Master Dean of the chapel, in robes
of crimson satin, with a red cross of St. George, and
after, eleven knights of the Garter in their robes; then
came the Queen, the sovereign of the Order, in her
robes, and all the guard following in their rich coats, to
the chapel. After service they returned through the
hall to her Grace's great chamber. The Queen and the
lords then went to dinner, where she was most nobly
served, and the lords sitting on one side were served on
gold and silver." This was followed by the election of
knights.


In 1564, towards the end of the war with France,
great alarm was felt about the defenceless condition of
the county. In January, Archbishop Parker reported to
Cecil;
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 176 -->

\"Dover, AA'almer and Deal are forsaken and
unregarded for any provision. The people are feeble,
unarmed and commonly discorrupted towards the feared
mischief. If the enemy have an entry as by consideration
of our weakness and their strength, of their vigilance
and our dormitation and protraction is like, the Queen's
Majesty shall never be able to leave to her successors that
which she found delivered her by God's favourable hand."


Lord Abergavenny ordered a levy of the gentlemen of
the South-Eastern Counties, and as the result was not very
satisfactory, at any rate proved by the exhibition of his
own armoury at Bekesbourne that he was ready.


In 1573 the Queen made a Progress through Kent.
She started from Greenwich on July 14th and went to
Croydon, where she remained a week as the guest of
the Archbishop. From Croydon she went to Sir
Percival Hart's house at Orpington, where she was
presented with a magnificent nautical masque which so
pleased her that she dubbed her host Bark Hart. Thence
she went to Knole, her own property, to Lord
Abergavenny's at Birlingham, and to the same nobleman's
seat at Eridge, where she stayed six days.


It was probably about this part of the journey that
Burleigh wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury, "The Queen
had a hard beginning of her Progress in the Wild of
Kent... where surely were more dangerous
rocks and valleys and much worse ground than in the
Peak."


Thence she went to Bedgebury at Goudhurst, where she
was presented by Culpeper, her host, with a silver bowl.
From here she went on to Hemsted and Rye. Thence
to Sissinghurst, whose proprietor she knighted. From
Sissinghurst she went through Smarden (where the
bellringers were paid two shillings and ten pence—about
two pounds of our money, for welcoming her) to Boughton
Malherbe, Hothfield, and to her own house at
Westenhanger. It is hard to realise from the remains
nowextant, picturesque though they be, how magnificent a
house was AVestenhanger three hundred years ago.
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 177 -->

We are told that it had nine towers, one hundred and
twenty-six rooms, three hundred and sixty-five windows,
and a fine chapel. During the recent operations in
connection with the formation of the new Folkestone
racecourse many interesting relics have been unearthed,
and it is pleasing to be able to record that not only are
these carefully preserved, but that the whole of the
buildings, after a narrow escape from being converted into
a tripper's holiday resort, are to be maintained, and, where
possible, judiciously restored by the gentleman at present
in occupation.


From AVestenhanger the Queen went to Folkestone—or,
rather, skirted it, and was given a splendid welcome by the
Gentlemen of Kent; from Folkestone to Dover and from
Dover to Canterbury, where she lodged at the Episcopal
Palace of St. Augustine. Her birthday happened to fall
during her stay here, and was celebrated with the greatest
pomp, no such assemblage of people having been in the
City before—not even when Henry VIII. came here on
his way to the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Elizabeth
remained at Canterbury fourteen days and went thence to
Sandwich.


Here she met with a great reception, was presented
with a cup worth a hundred pounds, and witnessed
nautical sports, amongst which "certain Wallounds
that could well swym had prepared two boates, and in the
middle of each boate was placed a borde, upon which
borde there stood a man, and so they met together,
with either of them a staff and a shield of wood, and
one of them did overthrowe another, at which the
Queene had good sport." It must have been a pretty
sight on the day of her departure when more than a
hundred English and Dutch children were ranged on a
turf bank and spun fine linen for the Queen's amusement.


From Sandwich the Queen returned to Canterbury,
thence she went to Sittingbourne, thence to Rochester,
where she stayed five days at the Crown Inn in order to
inspect her ships; from Rochester she went to Chatham,  
  
  
  N
<!-- Leaf 224, Page: 178 -->
where she stayed at the house of Mr. Watts, the founder
of the charity made famous by Charles Dickens as that
of the Seven Poor Travellers, and was so well entertained
there that she desired the house to be known ever after as
Satis House. From Chatham she passed on to Dartford,
where she lodged at Place House, erstwhile the residence
of Anne of Cleves, and so home to Greenwich.


In 1586 one of our most famous and beloved heroes,
Sir Philip Sidney, met his warrior's death on the field of
Zutphen in the Low Countries. Sidney had been
appointed Governor of Flushing. Spain and Holland
were then at war, and in 1585 Elizabeth promised to take
the Protestants of the Netherlands under her protection
and despatched a military force to their succour. Sidney
was elected Colonel of the Dutch regiments and Captain
of 200 English foot and 100 cavalry. He had gained
many small successes against the enemy, when on the
22nd September, 1586, a small detachment of English,
500 men, encountered a convoy of the enemy numbering
about 3,000, who were on their march to relieve Zutphen,
an obscure town in Guelderland. An obstinate
engagement took place under the walls of the fortress. Sidney
performed prodigies of valour. Early in the battle he had
a horse killed under him; he mounted another, rescued
Lord Willoughby from the most imminent peril, and
gallantly charged the enemy three times in one skirmish.
At length he received a musket shot from the trenches a
little above his left knee, which " so brake and rifted the
bone and so entered the thigh upward, so the bullet
could not be found before the body was opened."


AVe are told that an eccentric and chivalrous feeling of
emulation, caused by his having met the Marshal of the
camp only lightly armed, had induced Sir Philip to throw
off his cuisses before going into action, and thus to leave
exposed the parts of his frame which they protected. The
anguish of the wound and the loss of blood brought on so
much faintness that Sidney was obliged to leave the field.
Then comes the touching story of his relinquishing the
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 179 -->
drink of water to the dying soldier, as told by his friend,
Lord Brooke.


His uncle, the Earl of Leicester, in a letter to Sir
Thomas Heneage, says :


"I was abroad that time in the field, and meeting
Philip coming upon his horseback not a little to my
grief. But I would you had stood by to hear his most
loyal speeches to Her Majesty; his constant mind to the
cause, his loving care over me, and his most resolute
determination for death; not a jot appaled for his blow,
which is the most grievous that I ever saw with such a
bullet; riding so long, a mile-and-a-half to the camp, not
ceasing to speak still of Her Majesty, being glad if his
hurt and death might any way honour her; ' for her's he
was while he lived, and God's he was sure to be if he
died,' prayed all men to think that the cause was as well
Her Majesty's as the country's, and not to be discouraged,
' for you have seen such success as may encourage us all,
and this my hurt is the ordinance of God by the hap of
the war.'"


Sidney lingered sixteen days in severe and unceasing
pain, which he endured with the utmost sweetness and
composure. AVe are told that in order to divert his mind
he composed an ode (unhappily lost), which he caused to
be set to solemn music. His wife was at his bedside and
nursed him, and on October Nth he died.


Upon the news of his death the whole of England,
from the Queen to the lowliest subject, went into
mourning for him, an honour never before paid to any
subject, and it is related that for many months no
gentleman of quality ventured to appear in a light
coloured dress, either in the resorts of business or fashion.


He is described as "a gentleman finished and complete,
who trod from his cradle to his grave amid incense and
flowers, and died in a dream of glory; " also as " a true
model of worth, a man fit for conquest, plantation,
reformation, or what action soever is greatest and hardest
amongst men; withal such a lover of mankind and  
  
  
  x 2
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 180 -->
goodness that whosoever had real parts in him found
comfort, participation (sympathy) and protection to the
uttermost of his power."


The following description of the hero's funeral is from
the Custumale Roffense :


"In September at the releeving of Zutphen, he charged
the enemye thrice in one skirmishe, and in the last charge
he was wounded with a muskett shott whereof he died at
Arnheme the 17th October, from whence he was brought
by water to Vlishing, where he was kept eight days for his
convenient passage. On November 1st, 1586, he was
broughte from his house in Vlishing to the sea side by the
English garrison, which were twelve hundred, marching
three and three, the shott hanging downe their pieces, the
halberts, pykes, and enseignes trayling along the grounde,
drums and fyfes playing very softly.


"The bodye was covered with a paule of velvet, the
burghers of the towne followed mourning, and so soone as
he was imbarked the small shott gave him a triple vollye;
then all the great ordynaunce about the walles were
discharged twise, and so tooke theire leave of theire well
beloved governour. From thence he was transported in a
pynnis of his owne, which is here portrayde.


"All her sayles, tackling.and other furniture were coloured
blacke, and blacke cloth hanged rounde aboute her, with
escouchions of his armes, and was accompanyed with
dyvers other shipps. He was landed at Tower Hill,
London, the fifth of the foresayde month, and carried to
the Minorites."  
  
  
  On February 15th, 15S7, the funeral was at St. Paul's.


\"To sollempnize the same, there followed nexte unto
the mourners the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of
the Cittye of London, ryding in purple; after them the
Company of Grocers, of which he was free; and lastlye
certaine young men of the Cittye, marching by three and
three, in black cassokins, with their shott, pikes, halberds
and enseigne trayling on the grounde, to the number of
three hundred, who, so soon as he was interred, honored
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 181 -->
the obsequy with a double volley." The pall bearers were
his 'dear loving friends,' Thomas Dudley, Fulke Greville,
AVooton and Fryer. His brother, Sir Robert Sidney,
acted as chief mourner. (See Note E at the end of Tudor
Isent).


In 1580 there was an earthquake in Kent which was
felt at Sandwich and Dover, where part of the cliff fell;
part of Saltwood Castle was destroyed, the Hythe bells
were rung, and much damage was done at Great Chart
and Ashford.


In 1583 the Earl of Anjou came wooing the Virgin
Queen, and she coquetted with him, close upon fifty as she
was, just as she had coquetted with Spaniards, and
Hollanders, and Scotsmen in her political role, for, after
all, it was a political game she was playing in keeping him
in good humour as a representative of France. Even
when he, disgusted, started on his homeward journey she
accompanied him to Chatham and showed him her ships,
and to Sittingbourne, and as far as Canterbury, where she
bade him a tearful farewell, although she pursued the poor
man with messages until he fairly embarked at Sandwich.
(See Note F at the end of Tudor Kent).


AVe now come to the chief event of this reign, the
arrival and the destruction of the Spanish Armada, and
as the "Vanguard of Liberty" the County of Kent played
a part in the national defence, certainly second to none,
and perhaps more important than any.


The possibility of an invasion of England by Spain had
long been present in the minds of Englishmen—so long
that the only reason for the almost utter lack of
preparation for it can only be the utter dislocation of
national affairs under the papist reign of Mary.


\"The shadow of Spain already stretched beyond the
Andes," says Froude: " The shadow of this gigantic power
fell like a deadly blight over Europe," echoes Green. It
was in truth a blight, stifling, corrupting, blistering,
befouling wherever it settled, and as it was settling over
the greater part of the Christian world small wonder that
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 182 -->
the dread of it should be a hideous dream by day and
night in our little island. The fanaticism which had
turned the gentle, lute-playing, hysterical Mary Tudor
into a bloody mad woman, was raging amongst all ranks
of the Spanish people, and no more popular, because no
more holy, enterprise was conceivable in their minds than
the extirpation, if necessary, of the one European people
which dared to be heterodox, and more, was proud of its
heterodoxy, and actually flourished under its burden.  
  
  
  Briefly the causes of the sending of the Armada were:—  
  
  
  1.—The hatred of Popery in England, intensified a  
  
  
  hundred-fold by the atrocities of Alva and his
lieutenants in the Netherlands, and by the stories
of the doings of the Spaniards in the Indies  
  
  
  brought home by the Adventurers.  
  
  
  2.—English buccaneering.  
  
  
  On the first no comment need be made.


The second, buccaneering, had assumed such enormous
proportions that it might almost without exaggeration be
said to have become not only the staple industry of the
people of our Southern and AVestern Coasts, but a form of
speculation into which people of very high estate were not
ashamed of dipping deeply. Our Kent people were not a
whit behind those of the AA*estern Counties in their zeal
for this utterly indefensible yet much winked at business.
Dover and Margate men in particular seem to have
distinguished themselves, but Thomas Cobham of Cooling
Castle was one of the most reckless of individual
desperadoes. For attacking and sinking in the Bay of
Biscay a Spanish treasure ship, with the cargo of which he
made off, Elizabeth, who had hitherto paid but little
attention to the Spanish remonstrances which poured in,
sentenced him to be taken to the Tower of London,
stripped naked, placed with a sharp stone under each of
his shoulders, and on his stomach a gun too heavy for him
to bear, but not heavy enough to crush him at once.
There he was to be left till he died, with a few grains of
corn to eat, and foul water to drink.
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 183 -->
  
  This sentence however was really never carried out.


The preparations for the Armada were long known in
England. In January, 1584, the Governor of the Isle of
Wight wrote to Walsingham, Secretary of State, that a
ship master lately returned from Lisbon had informed him
of preparations being made for a navy, carrying many
thousands of men, to be commanded by the King in
person, of which the destination was England. In
December, 1585, this report was confirmed by a Devonshire
captain from Lisbon. Thomas Rogers, alias Nicholas
Berden, Walsingham's private agent abroad, kept his
master fully informed by a series of letters which
probably enabled AValsingham to checkmate Philip.
During 1586 Sir John Gilbert reported that an army of
60,000 men was being trained for an expedition against
England, and Sir Francis Drake reported similarly.


In 1585 active measures were taken in Kent. AVatches
were set at Hoo, Sheppey, Caule, Gray stone, Elmes,
Broadhull (Dymchurch), Seabrook, Sandgate and
Shorncliffe, whilst a series of beacons was established which
were to base their movements upon a signal from
Fairlight, near Hastings. (See Map, and Note G at the end
of Tudor Kent).


In 1586 a demand was made upon the South Eastern
Maritime Counties as follows :


Kent was to supply 1,500 men, 9,000 lbs. of powder,
9,000 lbs. of lead. Sussex and Hampshire, 1,600 men,
9,600 lbs. of powder, and 9,600 lbs. of lead.


The Cinque Ports, although much shorn of their ancient
power and wealth, were rated thus :


Folkestone, 4 ships. Hastings, 15. Sandwich, 43.
Hythe, 11. Faversham, 20. Ramsgate, 16. Deal, 6.
AA*almer, 5.


The following proportions borne by the Maritime
Counties of Southern and AA*estern England of the cost of
these early preparations show how Kent came to the
front.  
  
  
  Kent, £631 9s. 4d. Devon, £527 13s. 4d. Sussex and
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 184 -->
Hampshire, £399 5s. 4d. each. Dorset, £378 17s.
Cornwall £320 Is. 2d.


In April, 1588, Sir John Norris was appointed Royal
Commissioner of the Forces in Kent and on the South
East Coast; a great chain was fixed across the Medway
to Upnor, and batteries erected at a cost of £1,470; and,
at the same time, an extraordinary "aid" was levied, to
which Kent gave £5,025, Sussex £4,535, and Hampshire
£2,875.  
  
  
  The Kent command of land forces was as follows :


Sir Thomas Scott, of Scotts Hall, and Sir James Hales
commanded respectively the infantry and cavalry of East
Kent; Sir Henry Cobham and Sir Thomas Fane those of
AVest Kent. Altogether they had 13,000 foot and 1,000
horse, but this by no means represents the contribution of
our county to the national armament.


Sir Thomas Scott's instructions were to remain on the
watch at Shorncliff'e until he was relieved by Lord Cobham
with his trained archers, now armed with muskets or
calivers, as per letter to the Lord High Treasurer dated
July 12th, 1588. At the same time Sir James Hales with
the cavalry scouted along the Downs.


The East Kent force of 6,500 foot and 450 horse formed
the Van, the AVest Kent men of about the same number
were the " second battayl." All cattle were driven
inland and provisions in standing grain which could not be
used were to be destroyed.


In this arming of the archers with muskets and steel
bows we note the revolution wrought in warfare by the
use of gunpowder. A contemporary writer says :—" The
bow is our national weapon, good at home, but naught
abroad; the cross-bow flieth far and striketh forcibly; but
above all the steel bow which flieth twenty score yards
and can be discharged twice as fast as the cross-bow. The
most powerful weapon against all this enemy is the fear of
God."


In order to get as exact as possible an idea of the part
played by Kent in the defence of the country at this
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 185 -->
tremendous crisis, it is necessary to review the entire
disposition of the national forces.  
  
  
  There were four armies.  
  
  
  1.—The army for the defence of the Southern Coasts:

—that upon which the brunt of invasion might

be expected to fall.  
  
  
  
This consisted of 30,500 trained men, made up
of about 25,000 foot, 6,000 horse and 18 guns.  
  
  
  
To this Kent sent 4,000 men, Hampshire
4,000, Sussex 4,000, Devon 3,000 trained and
2,000 untrained, Cornwall 2,000, Dorset 1,500
trained and 500 untrained.  
  
  
  
These were divided into " cornets" of horse
and " ensigns " of foot. An " ensign " of foot
consisted of 200 men thus divided :—60
pikemen, 30 musketeers, 100 harquebusiers and 10
halberdiers.  
  
  
  2.—The army for the Queen's person.  
  
  
  
Consisting of 28,900 foot, 3,500 horse, and 36
guns.  
  
  
  To this Kent contributed 2,000 men.  
  
  
  3.—The army at Tilbury under the Earl of Leicester,

designed for the defence of London, and made up

of the London trained bands, stated variously at

11,000 and 16,000 men.  
  
  
  4.—The army at Stratford-at-Bow, made up largely of

Midlanders, consisting of 22,000 men from

eleven counties, to act in conjunction with the

Tilbury force.  
  
  
  
To this it is stated Kent was to send as many
as 5,000 men, but we doubt if Kent could spare
so many.


In addition, there was a cavalry force under the Lord
Steward at Brentwood, consisting of 203 lances and 669
lio-ht horse, drawn from seven counties, to which Kent
sent 50 lances and 100 light horse.


In order to secure the ports of the Kingdom, able, but
not trained, men were drafted as follows :
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 186 -->

Falmouth, 11,000. Plymouth, 17,000. Sussex Coast,
15,000. Sheppey, 20,000. Yarmouth, 13,800. Poole,
14,000. Portsmouth, 16,000. Harwich, 17,502. Suffolk
Coast, 13,300.


So far as we have been able to gather after a long and
minute examination of contemporary records the entire
force, at any rate summoned, if not assembled, for the
defence of the realm consisted of about 238,000 men,
made up of armed men—trained and untrained—able
men, pioneers, lances, and light horse.


Now if, in order to arrive at Kent's proportion of this
force, we add up Kent's contributions to the various
armies, we shall find the large total of 25,000 men, which,
bearing in mind the population of the time, not even our
patriotism will induce us to believe as correct. So we
must infer that when, for instance, Kent is represented as
contributing 5,000 men to the Stratford Army, if it was
done at all, it was at the expense of the other armies to
which Kent had contributed.


Possibly we are within, but not beyond, bounds when
we say that Kent's proportion of the entire force was
about 18,000 men, made up of 7,000 armed men—both
trained and untrained—and 11,000 able men.


Even the clergy bore their share in the national
movement, contributing 3,885 footmen and 559 horse. For
instance, the Archbishop sent four light horse men fully
equipped, besides having 100 of his servants trained and
armed; the Chapter sent the same number, and the Dean
two. The parson of Chartham was ready for two men or
£105; the parson of AA*rotham for two men or £134; the
Prebendary of Canterbury for two men or £118, whilst
the Bishopsbourne parson declared for two men or £202.


In a wealthy county like Kent this spirit of
volunteering aid was no doubt very general, and we may
certainly add to the 18,000 men, who may be considered
the regular force of the county, many hundreds of
volunteers recruited from the gentry and their adherents,
who, without actually taking up a position in the line of
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 187 -->
battle, held themselves in readiness to move to the front
much in the same way as did the " Minute Men" of
Massachusetts at the outbreak of the American
Revolutionary War.


Thus Somers speaks of a gentleman of Kent with a
band of one hundred and fifty others who were worth in
goods above £150,000, besides their lands, and he adds :


\"Such men would fight stoutly before they lost their
goods."


AA'e may be quite sure that when the " Warlike
errand "  
  
  
  " Roused in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent,"

the same spirit actuated them which prompted the
aged Earl of Shrewsbury to write to the Queen, "Though
I am old, yet your Majesty's quarrel shall make me young
again; though lame in body, yet lusty in heart to lend to
your greatest enemy one blow, to live and die in your
service," and Lord Morley to declare that, although his
estate had been very much reduced, he would have in
readiness 20 light horse, 30 muskets, and 70 calivers.


At Northbourne there w*as a camp under Captain Pike
of AValloons and Englishmen, all volunteers, consisting of
200 bow* and billmen, and 20 caliver men.


The system of beacons was very elaborate, and we have
thought it interesting enough to re-produce a map of those
in Kent, drawn up for Elizabeth by Sir William Brooke,
Lord Cobham, the Lord Chamberlain. The name of
\"beacon" still clings to many of these posts, and the
cresset of Tenterden long hung upon the church tower.


Nor was Kent behindhand in her contributions to the
naval force of the realm, although, owing to the decay of
the Cinque Ports, she could no longer bear the entire
brunt of invasion as in days gone by.  
  
  
  The English fleet was made up as follows :—  
  
  
  The Royal Fleet of 34 ships and 6,264 men.  
  
  
  Merchant „ 34 „ 2,394 „
City of London „ 29 „ 2,140 „
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 188 -->
  
  London Merchant Fleet 33 ships and 1,561 men,
Coasters 42 „ 2,036 „
Volunteers 23, 939 „  
  
  
  Total, 195 ships and 15,334 men.


Against this the Spaniards brought 166 larger ships
with 27,12S soldiers and sailors, 180 priests, and 1,493
guns. The Spanish fleet consisted of 40 great hulks, 60
galleons, 30 great ships, 4 galliasses, 8 galleys, and 24
pinnaces, and the armed force was made up of 1,600
Castilians, 3,000 Portingalls, 6,128 mariners, and 2,000

pioneers.


In addition to the Cinque Ports Fleet of five ships, of
which not one was under 60 tons, and a " handsome
pinnace," thus distributed : AVinchelsea, Hastings and
members 1 ship of 60 tons, Rye and members the same,
Romney the same, Dover 1 of ] 00 tons, Sandwich 1 of
80, Hythe the pinnace of 24 tons; the Ports held in
readiness smaller vessels as follows, manned by 1,195 men:


Sandwich, 33. Rye, 51. Dover, 26. Faversham, 27.
Ramsgate, 13. Hastings, 12. Hythe, 12. Lydd, 11.
Folkestone, 4. Deal, 5. AValmer, 3. St. Peter's, 6; and
others.


These were probably but lightly armed fishing boats, as
the average crew per boat was only six men.


Another large fleet of the same class of vessels was
contributed by AVhitstable, Milton, Rainham, Upchurch,
Halstow, Sittingbourne, Tong, Queenborough and Minster,
Gillingham, Rochester, Dartford, and Maidstone.


Some details as to the scale of victualling the soldiers
prove that our Elizabethan ancestors must have been
mighty trenchermen, and the exceedingly liberal scale for
the army contrasts strongly with the miserable parsimony
which made Elizabeth send the ships which were to fight
her battles to sea with no more than three days'
provisions, and with ammunition only for one day. In
fact we doubt if the troops ever got this allowance. At
any rate Leicester wrote to AValsingham with reference to
the troops under his command at Tilbury :
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 189 -->

\"There was neither a barrel of beer nor a loaf of bread
for them, but they said they would abide more hunger
than that to serve Her Majesty and the country."  
  
  
  These are the published scales of allowances :  
  
  
  Per day for a foot man—


Bread, 1£ lbs. Butter, | lb. Beer, 2 quarts. AVine, 1
quart. Cheese, 1 lb. Beef, 2|- lbs. " Biskett," 1 lb.  
  
  
  Per day for a horse man—


Bread, 2 lb. 4 oz. Beef, 3?r lbs. Butter, 12 oz. Cheese,
lJr lbs. Beer, 3 quarts. AVine, 3 pints. "Biskett,"
li lbs.


A few details about the Spanish Armada may be
interesting.


As the enterprise was essentially religious, the strictest
regulations were laid down for the conduct of the men on
board the ships. All personal quarrels were to be healed;
it was forbidden to blaspheme or renounce our Lord God,
or Our Lady, or the Saints upon pain of being sharply
punished. Every morning the ships' boys were to give the
Good Morrow at the foot of the main mast, and every
evening to say the Ave, and some days the Salve Regina,
or at least every Saturday, together with the "Lathanie."
AA*atch words were appointed for the days of the week;
for Sunday, Jesus; Monday, the Holy Ghost; Tuesday,
the Blessed Trinity; AA*ednesday, St. James; Thursday,
the Angels; Friday, All Saints; and Saturday, Our
Lady.


That the rumours current in England about the
intention of the Spaniards, if successful in their venture, to
force their religion upon Englishmen by the same gentle
methods practised in Spain, in the Netherlands, and in
America, were not ill-founded, is proved by a list of
instruments of torture found on the captured Spanish
vessels, given by Fox in his Book of Martyrs, prominently
chests full of thumb screws, " cravats," bilboes and
poisoned swords.


Tt is unnecessary to re-tell the oft-told tale of the utter
discomfiture of the Armada by a fleet, more than half of
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 190 -->
which, be it noted, was composed of merchant ships and
volunteers. During the great fight between Calais and
Dunkirk on Monday, August 9th, the coast of Kent,
whence assuredly the battle could have been seen, was
lined by the forces of Sir Thomas Scott and Sir John
Norreys, drawn up so as to make an imposing show, but
there was fated to be no opportunity granted for the men
of Kent to show their mettle.


How ready they were is evident from a letter, dated
July 31st, from Barry, the Lieutenant of Dover Castle, to
Walsingham, in which he commends the Cinque Ports for
furnishing thirty boats at a day's notice.


The great danger passed away. The Spaniards fought
as the Spaniards of that day always fought; not a ship
surrendered during the actual fighting, and many went
down with all hands on board and colours flying. But not
even this great salvation seems to have loosened the Royal
purse strings, for so late as September 14th Cobham writes
to Burleigh on behalf of the Dover and Sandwich people,
entreating the payment of two months' hire of their
ships and mariners. This request had to be repeated,
Hastings also claiming payment for her ship the "Anne
Bona venture."


In September, 1588, the Cinque Port contribution to
the fleet for the "Narrow Seas" was :


Dover, 5 ships, 265 men; Sandwich, 4 ships, 150 men;
Rye, 3 ships, 135 men; Faversham, 1 ship, 30 men.


There is nothing of importance connected with our
county during the remaining years of this reign. In 1597
a Greenwich man named Squires, an old sea-dog, who had
been captured by the Spaniards and actually tortured into
fanaticism for the Romish faith—in other words, racked
out of his mind, made a silly attempt to kill the Queen by
rubbing poison into the pommel of her saddle, and,
although he failed, he was executed with the usual
barbarities.


The execution of Essex, the Queen's favourite, in 1602,
produced a very marked effect upon her, and although on
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 191 -->
May Day she went maying in the glades of Lewisham,
and she affected to enter heartily into the revels and
festivities of the Court at Greenwich, she was in a
miserably depressed state.


Thus ended the reign of her whom poets and romancists
still love to celebrate under the name of Gloriana. No
other sovereign has left such indelible traces upon what
may be called the side life of rural England: no other
sovereign's name is linked with so many places or is
associated with so many legends, tales and episodes : no
other sovereign's relics—not even those of the so-called
Royal Martyr—are treasured with such pride and care,
and, be it added, of no other sovereign are so many relics
—genuine and spurious—extant. The romance of her
being a Virgin Queen has something to do with this
immortality, but a more potent cause is the fact that she
identified herself, socially as well as politically, with the
lives of her subjects, high and low. Possibly in all the
history of chivalry there is no more forcible example of
absolute devotion to a mistress than was shown by the
statesmen, the soldiers, the sailors, the writers, and the
poorest and humblest of cottage dwellers, to Queen
Elizabeth; and assuredly with no other county in England
is she so continuously and intimately associated as with
Kent.  
  
  
  GENERAL VIEW OF TUDOR KENT.


The claim of Kent to be considered one of the chief
industrial districts of England was furthered during this
period by the introduction of two industries which remain
to this day especially characteristic of the county—paper
making and fruit growing. *


Even to the outsider it is obvious that some special
reason must exist for the development of certain industries
in certain places, and so it is with these two Kentish
industries. In that part of Kent devoted to paper
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 192 -->
making there happens to be an almost unlimited supply of
pure spring water which can be used without filtration;
hence paper is made in Kent which can only be produced
in a few other districts of England.


The first paper mill in England is believed to have been
set up at Stevenage in Hertfordshire, but the next is
certainly that which Sir John Spielman started at
Dartford early in the reign of Elizabeth.


From Teynham, where was the cradle of the Kentish
fruit industry, then limited to apples and cherries, it has
spread almost over the whole face of West Kent, and
Kentish fruit, strawberries in particular, is sent in huge
quantities to every part of the kingdom.  
  
  
  Lambarde thus sums up the fertility of Kent :


\"The ile of Thanet and the Eastern parts are Grayner;
the Weald was the AVood; Romney Marsh is the
Medow Plot; the North Doune towards the Thamyse
be the Long Garthe or AVarreine; and this Tenham with
thirty other Parishes from Rainham to Blean AVood bee
the Cherrie Garden and Apple Orcharde of Kent."

The splendour of the Tudor Period generally, and of
Elizabeth's reign in particular, is abundantly reflected in
our County.


AVhen, upon the accession of Henry VIL, men began to
breathe freely after a period of strife and desolation, great
and rapid progress was made in the science of living.
Houses ceased to be fortresses and became stately and
beautiful homes, and with specimens of these Kent is
fairly rich, the most notable being Penshurst, Knole,
Cobham, part of Leeds, and manor houses such as
Bedgebury, Hollingboume, Godinton, Franks, Ightham Mote,
and Restoration House, Rochester. Chimneys came into
general use, carpets gradually replaced mshes in good
houses, although the German traveller Hentzner notes
that the floor of the presence chamber at Greenwich
Palace was strewed with "hay;" pillows were used, silver
plate adorned the table, pewter vessels replaced wood and
horn, and glass windows ceased to be a luxury confined to
the exceeding wealthy.
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 193 -->

Most of our Kentish Grammar Schools, like those
elsewhere, were founded by the Tudors, although the most
ancient, that of Sevenoaks, dates back to 1418. These
are the principal :


Tenterden, 1520; Biddenden, 1522; Faversham, founded
in 1527, abolished at the Dissolution, and re-founded in
1576; Rochester, 1542; Canterbury, 1542; Wye, 1545;
Tunbridge, 1552; Maidstone, 1562; Sandwich, 1563;
Cranbrook, 1574; and Sutton Valence, 1578.  
  
  
  Some Tudor prices in Kent are interesting :


A bullock of iOh stone, at 81bs. to the stone, cost £2 5s.,
Tudor money; a wether cost 6s. 6d.; an ewe, 5s. 5d.; a
lamb, 2s. 6d.


Bread, now at 7d. the 41b. loaf, cost 2s. 6^d.; beef, now
about 10?,d. a lb., was Is. 3ld.; beer was much the same
price as now; cheese was Is. 3d. against about 9d.


A soldier received eight pence a day, a workman about
ten pence, a reaper three shillings per acre, a common
labourer from three half-pence to four pence a day. See also
a paper in Arch. Cant. XXII. by Revd. C. E. AVoodruff
upon wages paid in Maidstone during Elizabeth's reign.


AA*e described Elizabeth's progress through Kent in
1573, and we append some accounts from the Faversham
Registers of that year, which give some idea of how costly
a matter it was to entertain Her Majesty, and this
without considering the expense incurred by the private
individual whose house she honoured, sometimes with a
sojourn of more than a week.


\"Drum and flute coats, 4s. 8d.; Bear wards, 6s. 8d.;
1 dozen torches and 24 links, 16s. Od.; couchemen, 10s. Od.;
pursuivants, 10s. Od.; mummers, 10s. Od.; supper to Her
Majesty, £27 2s. Od.; Porters, £1 Os. Od.; Yeoman of
flagons, 10s. Od.; Green taffetee for Mr. Fynche's son that
made the oration before the Queen, £1 4s. Od."


Towards the glorious literature of this period Kent
contributed her very fair share. Thomas Sackville, Earl
of Dorset, planned and wrote part of the Mirror for  
  
  
  cj
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 194 -->
Magistrates, a metrical biography of English historical
personages from our earliest history, but his fame rests
rather upon his tragedy of Gorboduc or Ferrex and Porrex,
remarkable far more for being the first-known instance
of the employment of blank verse in English dramatic
composition than for its intrinsic merits.


Sir Henry Wotton, poet, statesman, and man of letters,
best known perhaps by his lyric which opens  
  
  
  " Vou meaner beauties of the night,"

addressed to the Queen of Bohemia, daughter of James I.

Sir Thomas Wyatt, of Allington, the lover of Anne

Boleyn, of whom his son, in Tennyson's Queen Mary,
says :  
  
  
  " Courtier of many Courts, he loved the more
His own gray towers, plain life anil letter'*! peace,
To read and rhyme in solitarj* fields;  
  
  
  The lark ahove, the nightingale below,
And answer them in song."


He was a friend of the unfortunate Earl of Surrey—
another Sidney—anil the acknowledged introducer of
blank verse into our literature; their poems were published
together, and their names are usually linked as at the head
of our new poetry.


There was Christopher Marlowe, of Canterbury,
described as the greatest dramatic writer before Shakespeare,
author of Faustus, Tamburlaine the Great, The Jew of
Malta, Edward the Second, and many other plays.


There was Lyly, the inventor of that fantastic style
known as Euphuism, ridiculed bv Holofernes in
Shakespeare's Love's Labour Lost, and later by Scott in the
Monastery, as represented by Sir Piercie Shafton.


There was Sidney, the " warbler of poetic prose," as
Cowper calls him,  
  
  
  ' Sydney, than whom a gentler, braver man,
His own delightful genius never feigned,
Illustrating the vales of Arcadj*  
  
  
  AVith courteous courage and with loyal loves,"  
  
  
  as Southey writes, the author of Arcadia, addressed to
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 195 -->
his sister, the Countess of Pembroke, the inspires of the
exquisite epitaph by Ben Joiison; of Astrophel and Stella,
addressed to Penelope Devereux, daughter of the Earl of
Essex, and of various songs and sonnets.


There was John Fletcher of Cranbrook, joint author with
Beaumont of more than thirty plays, sole author of eleven,
of which the best known is the Faithful Shepherdess. He
is also an interesting personage from his intimate
association with Shakespeare. AVhen on June 29th, 1613,
the Globe Theatre was burned down by the accidental
discharge of the piece of ordnance which announced in
Shakespeare's play of King Henry the Eighth, or, to be
more correct, of the play called " All is true," in which
was embodied Henry the Eighth, the masked visit of the
King to AA*olsey, Shakespeare's play was lost. Another
play was written on the same subject by Shakespeare,
Fletcher, and perhaps Massinger, and is that which is now
included amongst Shakespeare's works.


It is easy to distinguish between the smooth and
polished diction of Fletcher and the more irregular and
impulsive work of Shakespeare, says a recent writer in the
Contemporary Review, who apportions the play between
the two writers so that Fletcher appears to have written
the greater part of it.


As indirectly associated with our county it may be
mentioned that Spenser wrote the Shepherd's Calendar
when a guest at Penshurst, and that it was at Sayes Court,
Deptford, that Raleigh was the hero of the cloak and
puddle episode.


A brief notice of the progress of the National Navy
under the Tudors may fitly close this period of our history.
Royal Navy there was none until the reign of Henry VIII.,
when, in 1512, the Navy Office was instituted, and the
work of building and equipping ships for the National
service came under the immediate control of the
Government. Until then the Cinque Ports really supplied the
National wants in this department; the ships were built
of Kentish timber in Kentish yards and manned by Kent
and Sussex men.  
  
  
  0 Z
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 196 -->

However, the Great Harry, built at Chatham in 1488,
may be considered as the first ship, properly speaking, of
the R-oyal Navy. James, in his introduction to his Naval
History, speaks of her as remaining the only three-masted
ship in the Navy until 1545, and alludes to her having
been well built, as she lasted until 1553, when she was
accidentally burned at AVoolwich. But we read elsewhere
of a Great Harry built at Erith under Henry VIII., which
had four masts, each with two round fighting tops, sails
of cloth of gold damasked, the Royal Standard at each
corner of the forecastle, St George's banner at each
quarter of the deck, her quarters, sides and tops lined
with " heater " shields, and the arms of England and France
at bow and stern. Also, that her armament consisted of
about 60 brass and iron guns of various kinds, that she
had a 20 and a 22 inch cable and an 8 inch hawser, and
that she carried 301 marines, 349 soldiers, and 50 gunners.
Either there were two Great Harrys, or the old one was
altered.


Also in Henry VII.'s reign was built the Henry Grace
de Dieu, at a cost of £14,000, with 70 guns mounted
on two decks. Under Henry VIII. was built at Woolwich
the Regent of 1,000 tons burden, and at Erith a second
Henry Grace de Dieu, also of 1,000 tons, at the exact cost
of £6,478 8s. Ofd.! Henry VIII. is rightly to be regarded
as the father of the English Navy, for it was under him
that the force assumed a national shape, and that the
moral embodied in the following lines came to be
recognised :  
  
  
  " Cherish marehandize, keepe the Admiraltie,
That we bee masters of the narrow sea;
The ende of battaile is peace siekerly,
And power causeth peace finally.  
  
  
  Keepe then the sea, about in special
Wllich of England is the town wall;  
  
  
  Keep then the sea, that is the wall of England,
And then is England kept by Oodde's hand."

He spent £65,000 on Dover Harbour, enacted severe
laws for the regulation of the growth and cutting of
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 197 -->
timber, founded the Royal Dockyards at Woolwich and
Deptford, the Trinity House, and, as we have mentioned,
the Navy Office.


After the first years of his reign, however, his zeal
for the Navy cooled; we soon had practically no Navy
at all, and foreign ships landed and sacked our coast towns
at will. In 1536 we had scarcely a man-of-war in the
Channel; the harbour construction works at Dover were
constantly interrupted by French and Flemings, and ships
were openly attacked and robbed under the very guns of
Dover Castle.


In 1539 there was a re-awakening consequent upon
Henry's open defiance of the Papacy, and therefore of all
Roman Catholic nations. The lands belomrinn* to the
CT O
suppressed religious houses were sold, and the proceeds
applied to the National Armament, so that when the
King died in 1547 he left the Navy in a better state
than it had ever been in before, consisting of 30 ships
with a tonnage of 10,330, 15 "row barges," and the
dockyards of Woolwich and Deptford in full swing.


Under Edward VI. there was a decline, chiefly owing
to dissensions between the Protector and his brother the
Lord High Admiral.


Under Mary the English supremacy of the sea was
proudly asserted, even Philip of Spain being made to
salute the flag by Lord Howard of Effingham when he
came to marry the Queen. Still the Navy declined. At
the beginning of Elizabeth's reign the Royal Navy
consisted of but 21 ships, of which the largest was 800 tons,
and of 45 merchantmen with enough arms for 3,000 men.
In 1587 there were actually only nine ships in commission,
and at the time of the Armada but 28, which was
increased to 34 at the actual hour of crisis. There was
an honourable competition between the three chief
Elizabethan ship-wrights, Peter Pett, Matthew Baker,
and Richard Chapman, with the result that ships were
thoroughly well built. Thus, the Elizabeth, launched in
1588, was afloat in 1618; and the Marye Rose, launched
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 198 -->
in 1566, was only condemned in 1618. During the entire
reign only two Queen's ships were taken by the Spaniards,
and not one was lost by fire, or weather, or running
aground.


Chatham seems to have been the chief Elizabethan
ship-building yard—at any rate it cost the most.


Upon the accession of James I. the Royal Navy
consisted of 42 vessels of 17,000 tons, manned by 8,400 men.


By this time the Cinque Ports had so decayed that the
number of ships belonging to Hythe had dwindled from
eighty to eight, and of AVinchelsea it was reported " there
are at present no ships, and the town is greatly decayed."

  NOTES ON TUDOR KENT.  
  
  
  A.


The original seal of the Citj* of Canterbury had on its obverse a
complicated system of towers, and on its reverse the martyrdom
of Thomas ii Becket. In the Corporation entries, 1541-2, appears
the following item :


\"Paid to William Oldfield, belfounder, for puttyng out of
Thomas Bekket in the common seale aud gravyng agayu of the
same."  
  
  
  A poor representation of the city arms was substituted.  
  
  
  B.


AA*e are asked not to believe a good deal about the vengeance
taken upon Thomas a Becket's remains under Henry VIII. The
head so long presented to be kissed by pilgrims who could afford
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 199 -->
to paj* the required fee is said to have been a sham of tlie early
fourteenth century, indeed is as good as proved not to be the
original by the 1888 discovery, which seems to point to the fact
that the remains were buried entire under the round tower of St.
Thomas's chapel—that is, in 1538.


This does away with the accepted story about the scattering of
Becket's ashes by order of Henry VIII. At any rate the only
evidence we have to go upon with respect, not merely to the
desecration of the Archbishop's remains, but to his mock trial, is
in the angry complaint of the Pope. Indeed the story of his trial
is said to be no earlier than the seventeenth century. Henry
concerned himself far more about the decorations and offerings at the
shrine than about Thomas's personal relics, and there seems no
reason to doubt that the latter were decentlj* buried without let or
hindrance.

  " Myne owne sweetheart;


"This shall be to advertise j*ou of the great ellingness
(solitariness) that I find here since your departing; for I assure you
me thinketh the tyme longer since your departing now last, than I
was wont to do a whole fortnight. I think your kindness and my
fervence of love causeth it, for otherwise I would not have thought
it possible that for so little a while it should have grieved me; but
now that I am comeing towards you methinketh my pains have been
half released, and also I am right well comforted.
Wishincr myself (specially an evening) in my sweetheart's armes, whose
pretty duekys I trust shortly to kysse. Written with the hand of
him that was, and is, and shall be, yours by his will,

Elizabeth had either more or less encouraged herself, or who had
been suggested to her, or had been pressed to marry. No clearer

"An order for the readie and easie trayning of shott, and the
avoyding of great expence and waste of powder :—The leaders and
captaines who are appointed to iustructe and traine them shall
cause an holbert to be sett up in the plaine, whereby every shott
maie passe in that order which the french men call "a la file," or as

to present his piece, and make offer as thoughe he would shoote,
and those which doe not behave themselves with their pieces as they

ignorant people, in which time may be discerned those that cannot
frame themselves in any likelihood to prove shott, in whose roomes
the captaines maie require others to be placed who are more apt

  STEWART KENT.  
  
  
  Part I.—James I. and Charles I. to L312.  
  
  
  James I. 1603-1625.

JAMES, strange contrast mentally and physically to

the majestic, imperial Tudors who preceded him, was

very fond of Greenwich Palace, and passed much
time hunting in the Park after bis own peculiar fashion,
propped and bolstered up on his horse so that he could
not have fallen off if he had tried to, as described in Scott's
Fortunes of Nigel.


It may be noted that the first Protestant baptism of a
Royal infant in England, that of the Princess Mary,
took place at Greenwich.


This was an age of plotting and intrigue, and we find
the tenth Lord Cobham deeply involved with Raleigh and
others in a couple of plots known respectively as the Main
or Spanish Treason, and the Bye or Priests' Treason.


The real character and object of the first have always
been veiled in obscurity, but although it was supposed to
have hinged upon the placing of Arabella Stewart, cousin
of the King, upon the throne, it was probably but a plot
of Raleigh and Cobham against their political enemy
Essex, who was now in favour and was making them feel
his influence, in which France was to play a part.


For this Cobham and Raleigh were condemned, and
their trials are not edifying and not very creditable to
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 207 -->
either, for Cobham turned on Raleigh, who, under
examination, had hinted at Cobham's implication, and
Lingard says that Raleigh betrayed Cobham as having had
secret communications with Arenberg, the ambassador of
the Archduke. Raleigh denied it, but when he was
confronted with his own letter to Cecil, in which Cobham was
alluded to, he was guiltily amazed and confounded.


Cobham got off with going through all the horrors of
death on the scaffold without being actually executed, and
was sent to the Tower, whence he was released on sick
leave in 1617, to which he returned in 1618, and where he
died in 1619, not, as has been often stated, starved and
deserted in a Minories hovel.


Raleigh's sentence was also commuted and he was sent
to the Tower, whence he was released to go upon his
luckless voyage to Guiana, and returned to be executed in
order to gain the favour of Spain.


The Bye Plot or Priests' Treason had for its object the
seizure of the King's person. Cobham, and his brother
George Brooke, were concerned in this, as, is believed, was
Raleigh, but nothing came of it, and the priests concerned
were executed.


A Muster of the County of Kent for 1603 shows :—
7,500 able men, 3,000 armed men, 250 pioneers, 20
demilancers and 200 " high horses."


In this year the King's father-in-law, King Christian IV.
of Denmark, paid a state visit. He landed at Gravesend,
proceeded thence to Greenwich, and whilst there spent
much of his time hunting at Eltham—this being the last
record of a royal visit to this ancient palace. On his
return journey he was presented at Greenwich with various
sports—bear and bull-baiting, and tilting, and inspected
the Royal fleet at Chatham during his stay at Rochester.


AA'e get a fair notion of the character of the Court at
Greenwich at this time from Harington's description of a
masque held in honour of Christian. He says :


\"After dinner the representation of Solomon's Temple,
and the coming of the Queen of Sheba was made, or
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 208 -->
meant to have been made. But alas ! as all earthly things
fail to poor mortals in enjoyment, so proved this. The
lady who played the Queen's part carried precious gifts to
both their majesties; but, forgetting the steps arising to
the canopy, overset her caskets into his Danish Majesty's
lap, and fell at his feet, or rather into his face. Much
hurry and confusion ensued, and cloths and napkins made
all clean. His Majesty then got up and would dance with
the Queen of Sheba; but he fell down and humbled
himself before her, and was carried to an inner chamber,
and laid in a bed of state, which was not a little defiled
with the presents which had been bestowed upon his
garments; such as wine, cream, jelly, spices, and other good
matters.


\"The entertainment and show went forward, and most
of the presenters went backwards, or fell down, wine so
occupied their upper chambers. Then appeared in rich
dresses, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Hope tried to speak,
but wine so enfeebled her endeavours that she withdrew,
and hoped the King would excuse her brevity. Faith
followed her from the royal presence in a staggering
condition. Charity came to the King's feet, and,
seemingdesirous to cover the sins of her sisters, made a sort of
obeisance; she brought gifts, but said she would return
home again; she then returned to Hope and Faith, who
were both sick in the lower hall. Next came Victory in
bright armour, and presented a rich sword to the King,
who waved it away, but Victory persisted in a strange
medley of versification, till, after much lamentable
utterance, she was led away like a captive, and laid to
sleep on the outer steps of the ante-chamber. Peace took
offence in endeavouring to get up to the King, and
wielded her olive branch in warlike assault upon the heads
of the attendants."


Prince Henry at this time resided with his tutor, Adam
Newton, at Charlton House. He was a young prince of
great promise and was dearly beloved by the people; of
him the elder Disraeli says :—"He would have proved an
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 209 -->
heroic and military character. Had he ascended the
throne the days of Cressy and Agincourt would have been
revived, and Henry the Ninth had rivalled Henry the
Fifth."


He was an all-round athlete as well as a scholar, and it
was no doubt under his auspices that the Royal Blackheath
Golf Club was founded. He also took a patriotic interest
in naval matters, and, knowing that his father's favourite,
Carr, and his faction had a spite against Phineas Pett, the
Chief Constructor, determined that on the occasion of the
launch of the Charles, one of the largest ships ever built
for the Royal Navy, at Woolwich in 1611, the Court
should be present at the ceremony in order to prevent any
malicious action. Unfortunately there was a hitch, and
the ship stuck on the stays, so that the Court, after waiting
a long time, had to go off; this, in an age of witchcraft
belief, was attributed to Carr's evil influence, and had
not the ship got afloat that evening he would probably
have heard of it. Prince Henry died this same year to the
universal grief.


In 1617 James paid a visit to his native land, and
during his absence the Queen resided at Greenwich.
AA'hilst here the young ladies of a Deptford
boardingschool presented a Masque before Her Majesty entitled
Cupid's Banishment. There is nothing notable about this
fact except that this is believed to be the first mention of
a ladies' boarding school in English history, it having been
the custom heretofore for girls to be educated in convents.


Saturated with that notion of the Divine Right of
Kings, which he had enlarged upon in his Discourse on the
True Law of Free Monarchies, and the application of which
led to the disastrous events of the next reign, James was
engaged in a constant conflict with his Parliaments,
although it was his own conceit rather than a hankering
after power which inspired him. Amongst the many
grievances which vexed the people was the arbitrary
imposition of taxes upon merchandise by the King, of
course without any reference to Parliament, in which he  
  
  
  r
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 210 -->
was backed up by venal and favour-currying judges. The
manufacturing districts of Kent felt this very severely. In
1616 the exportation of white or undyed cloths was
prohibited, although there is little doubt that those who
were willing to pay for the privilege could export so much
as they liked. As this particular trade had always been
an important branch of the Kentish industry, it meant
something like stagnation, and, in consequence, some 3,000
Kentish cloth-weavers emigrated to the Palatinate and
there started factories.


Similar statutes injured the woollen industry, and,
although in response to the high duties levied by the
Dutch on imported wool an effort was made to foster the
inland trade by such measures as the renewal of the order
that all people of a certain position should be buried in
shrouds of sheep's wool only, the trade gradually decayed.


In 1625 the Plague seems to have raged virulently in
Kent. Ashford and Kennington suffered severely, and we
find record of an order that the Half Hundred of
Calehill contribute £1 19s. 6d. to assist the inhabitants of
these places. The Plague increasing, the justices report
that the inhabitants of Ashford "are not able to relieve
and orderly to attend the sick, and to beare about the
charges of theyr other poore Artificers who, for want of
trade, must of necessity be provided for, or els they will
be forced for the succor of theyr lives to breake forthe of
that towne to the danger of the country."


So the said Half Hundred had to collect £3 for a
month's provision of Ashford.


AVe may note that Sir Thomas Kuevett, Steward of
Westminster, who arrested Guy Fawkes, was a Kent man.


During this reign the picturesque so-called Jacobean
style of domestic architecture came into vogue. In Kent,
perhaps, the most notable examples are Chilham Castle,
and parts of Cobham, Knole, and Lullingstone.  
  
  
  Charles I. 1625-1642.


AVe are now arrived at the most momentous and
interesting period in the History of England, and by no
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 211 -->
means the least interesting in that of our county, and
this must be our excuse for its treatment at some length,
and for what may occasionally seem digressions beyond
our defined limits.


So few are the pleasant scenes that we shall be able to
record during this eventful reign that we must be
pardoned for opening with one of them at the risk of
its being deemed unworthy of what is called the " dignity
of history."


It is the meeting at Dover of Charles with his bride,
Henrietta Maria, the beautiful, iron-willed woman who
was so fatally to influence the Royal destiny. Charles
was at Canterbury when the Queen arrived at Dover after
a stormy passage, and the messenger who brought him the
news is said to have performed the journey of fifteen
miles in thirty-six minutes, which we don't believe for a
quarter of a minute. Charles hastened to Dover Castle
to greet her, and, noticing her to be taller than he had
expected, he glanced at her feet to see if she wore high
heels, which she perceiving, said : " Sir, I stand upon my
own feet : I have no help from art: thus high am I,
neither higher nor lower."


Leaving Dover for Canterbury they halted on Barham
Downs, where a banquet awaited them; the gentry of
Kent were mustered on horse, and the English ladies of
the Royal Household assembled to be presented.


At Canterbury they went to the Palace (of which the
only relic to-day is an arch in Palace Street), where was
held a magnificent entertainment at which the King
himself carved for the Queen. Here they were married
on June 24th, 1625. From Canterbury they went to
Gravesend, and thence by water to London, where,
although the Plague was raging, they had a great
reception.


From the very outset it became evident that Charles was
even more fully imbued with the notion of the Divine Right
of Kings than had been his father, and was more
determined to assert it—an unfortunate resolve, asParliaP2
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 212 -->
ment happened to contain a number of very able and
strong-willed men, and was in no mood to be bullied. So
we find the King in the first year of his reign in conflict
with the Commons.


Sir Dudley Digges, of Chilham, was one of the eight
managers of the impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham,
the King's favourite and master, and for this he and the
famous Sir John Eliot, " the most illustrious confessor in
the cause of liberty whom that time produced," as Hallam
calls him, were arrested by the King's order and thrown
into the Tower.


This unwarrantable attack upon its privileges aroused
the House, and it refused to proceed to business until its
members were released. As business in the King's mind
meant simply the granting him supplies, he yielded,
admitted his error and the prisoners were released.


It was on this occasion that Sir Dudley Digges, incensed
at the jaunty way in which Buckingham received the news
of his impeachment, made the famous remark :


\"Do you jeer my Lord ? I can show you when a greater
man than your Lordship, as high as you in place and
honour, and as deep in the King's favour, has been hanged
for as small a crime as these articles contain ! "


It was this same Sir Dudley by whose will originated
the quaint old custom, observed until comparatively
recently, of the race on Old AA'ives Lees at Chilham
between a young man and a young woman for XI0 a side.


In 1626 the King, in the absence of regular suj*irjlies
from Parliament, made a demand for a general loan, -u ith
promise of repayment within eighteen months, to be levied
according to the rate at which the people were assessed for
the last subsidy; and the Commissioners appointed for the
collection thereof were instructed to certify the names of
refractory persons to the Privy Council and not to accept
any abatement of the amount demanded.


This produced an uproar. In Kent the loan was
peremptorily refused—" Kent stood out to a man," on
the principle that no subsidy had received the assent of
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 213 -->
Parliament and that it had nothing to do with loans levied
without such assent.


The result of this was that five knights—Darnel, Corbet,
Hampden, Heveningham and Earl—were arrested and
imprisoned, and upon their appeal to be brought up on a
writ of Habeas Corpus, with the articles of their
indictment fully show-n, it was refused upon the grounds that
they had been committed by special command of the King
without particular cause being shown.


To this case, known as Darnel's, w*e owe the continued
assertion by Parliament of the fundamental immunity of
English subjects from arbitrary detention, and its
subsequent establishment by 31, Car. II.


But judgment was given for the Crown, and the five
knights were remanded to prison. By this decision every
statute from the Great Charter downwards became a dead
letter, and the wound was the more deadly because the
notorious cause of imprisonment was a refusal to pay an
illegal exaction.


The prisoners, however, were released in June, 1628, in
which year the King called his third Parliament.


In the vehement discussions which took place upon the
various tyrannies and misdeeds of the Crown, and in the
conference held by the two Houses which led to the
Petition of Right, Digges took a prominent part, and was
one of the managers for the Commons.  
  
  
  Briefly, the Petition of Right dealt with :  
  
  
  1,—Illegality of forced loans. 2.—Commitment of  
  
  
  those who refused. 3.—Billeting of soldiers.  
  
  
  4.—Martial law.

Whilst it absolutely deprived the King of the power of
committing those who refused to contribute.


In 1630 the King endeavoured to add to his revenue by
prohibiting the export of wool, although he sold the
privilege. This put a premium upon smuggling, which was
carried on to an enormous extent on the Kentish coast,
especially from Romney Marsh and the lone creeks and
inlets about the mouths of the Stour, in the neighbourhood
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 214 -->
of Sandwich, liquor being received from the Frenchmen and
Dutchmen in exchange, nor could theStatute of 1674,
which made it felony to export wool, stop the practice.


The abuse of the levy of ship-money was the next stroke
widening the gap between King and people. This was
calculated to produce about a million per annum, modern
money. The first writ was issued in 1634 for £10,400, and
was pretty generally paid. Noy is credited with the
disinterment of this ancient right of our sovereigns to levy
ship-money upon coast towns, but Finch is responsible for
its extension to inland places.


The ordinary form of writ was for a ship of a certain
tonnage, armed with so many guns, equipped with so many
crew, and supplied with provisions for six months, to be
ready for the service of the King at a certain seaport on a
certain day. The cost was levied by a " distress," and
refractory people were imprisoned.


James Mann, of Bromley, declined to pay for Kent on
the plea that he was already contributing as a citizen of
London. He was ordered to appear before the Privy
Council, but history does not record the result.


In April, 1636, we find a petition from Canterbury
praying for an abatement of assessment, having already
paid £550 and £400; and in 1640 Maidstone objects to
pay more than the proportion of £100 per 100 tons, and is
reprimanded by the Privy Council.


In 1639, Sir John Colepeper, of Leeds, as distinguished,
although moderate, a Royalist as was Digges a champion
of Parliament, was amongst the foremost in forcing the
resignation by the King of the iniquitous monopoly
system. His speech, so loyal, yet so emphatic in its
declamation of wrongs, which Rushworth gives in full,
makes the perversity and pride of Charles all the more
detestable.


In 1640 there was an attempt to raise soldiers in Kent
to serve against the Scots, but such as were enlisted,
composed of farmers and yeomen, were reported to be
restive, unruly and insubordinate.
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 215 -->

In the same year Sir Edward Dering, described as "an
honest but not very enlightened man," brought up a
petition from the County of Kent, complaining of the
abuse of power by archbishops, bishops, deans and
archdeacons, "who suspend and punish good ministers
without reason, that few of them preach the AVord
themselves, but countenance Papists, hinder the printing
of good books, deform churches with Popish pictures and
altars, revive antiquated ceremonies, such as standing at
hymns and at the Gloria, turning to the East, bowing to
the altar; that they abuse the power of excommunicating,
claim their office jure divino, occupy temporal places, awe
the judges, hinder Habeas Corpus, etc., profane the Lord's
Day by tolerating sports thereon, and suspend ministers
for not reading the Book of Sports." The petition prays
for the abolition of episcopacy, and the second reading of
the bill which was consequently brought in was carried on
a division by 139 to 108. But there was a strong feeling
in the County that this was too much of a concession to
Puritanism, and a second petition was presented in 1641
on behalf of "The gentrie, ministers, freeholders and
subsidy men within the County of Kent" for reform, which
should stop short of the abolition of episcopacy.


It is absolutely necessary in order to enter upon an
intelligently comprehensive survey of events affecting our
county first briefly to consider the Long Parliament.


It met in November, 1640. Its first session lasted rather
longer than ten months, and almost entire unanimity
prevailed owing to its resolve that the abuses which had
existed during so many years of misrule should be
abolished and redressed, and the instruments of the
King's tyranny punished.


It received petitions and complaints, and enacted that
all canons unsanctioned by Parliament were illegal: that
a Parliament should be summoned every three years, and
sit for thirty days. The Courts of Star Chamber, High
Commission, and of York were abolished. The judgment
in favour ofShip Money reversed : Finch, Laud and
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 216 -->
Strafford were impeached, and on the day on which the
Act passed the King assented to a law binding him not to
adjourn, prorogue or dissolve Parliament without its own
{empty}.consent. After a recess of six weeks the Houses met
again, and it was evident that it was now divided into
two Parties, Royalist and Popular, afterwards Cavaliers
and Roundheads, and, later still, Tories and AA*higs. The
former were of opinion that enough had been done for the
present, abuses redressed, rights vindicated and surrounded
with new securities, and that it was necessary to take
care that the victory over despotism should not end in
anarchy.


The latter knew that no real securities had been given,
nothing but the King's word, on which they could not
rely, and that he was no more likely to respect the new
laws than he had the old.


AA'hilst thus separating, news came which excited the
passions and confirmed the opinions of both—the Irish
Rebellion.


The Cavaliers maintained it a duty rendered by this
that every good Englishman and Protestant should
strengthen thc hands of the King : the Roundheads that
no precaution was necessary, that they had no security
that if an army was raised for the reduction of Ireland
it would not be turned against the liberties of the country.


Now came the first great Parliamentary struggle. The
Roundheads moved that a Remonstrance should be
presented to the King, enumerating the faults of his
Government, and expressing the distrust with which it was still
regarded. It was carried by eleven votes, and this result
shows that if the King had been prudent there would soon
have been a majority for his side. His first steps promised
well. He announced his intention of governing
constitutionally, and called Falkland, Hyde and Colepeper to his
councils.


Then he committed the great error of his life. Irritated,
it is said, by some hints which were dropped of impeaching
the Queen, he attempted to seize the five members—
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 217 -->
Hollis, Hazlerig, Hampden, Pym, and Strode—whilst
Parliament was in session.


This breach of the privileges of Parliament, that is, this
outrage upon the liberty of the subject, for it must be
remembered, as Mr. Harrison says, that "Parliament as a
legislature had ceased to exist; it was a committee of
safety of the nation charged with the duty of forcing the
King to submit," produced an explosion of anger to which
all previous outbursts had been mere fire-works, united
again the two parties in one phalanx of opposition, put
all London in arms, roused the city to such a fury that in
a few days the King left it, and brought addresses of
fidelity to Parliament from a score of counties.


That from Kent to the peers was carried bodily by a
number of freeholders; this was its tenor :


\"AV'herein His Gracious Majesty, seduced by the
Malevolent Counsell of an ill affected party of Malignants
and Cavaliers; the Protestant Religion, his Royall Person,
and Honour, the Priviledge of Parliament, and the subjects'
liberty are threat'ned with too apparent hazard and
ruine :


"Wee, the knights, gentry, and commonalty of the
County of Kent, according to the duty of Loyall Subjects
and good citizens, are not only willing to contribute our
best wishes and votes, but even to the utmost of their
endeavours, both with their lives and their fortunes, for
the redressing of His Majesty from such hands, and our
Liberty and Religion from such perill and danger.


\"May it please this Honourable House to consider that
wee do apprehend themselves in a condition and posture
nothing suitable to this their Resolution, being deprived
and left naked by the taking of our arms from us, and
therefore beseech your provident care to impower us with
such a proportion of arms and ammunition to be
magazined in these parts, whereby wee may be inabled to
manifest our affection and obedience to the Counsel of
King and Parliament."  
  
  
  It was added that the petitioners endorsed the action
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 218 -->
of Parliament in taking away the votes of the prelates,
and disabling them from temporal employments, and
asserting that they will defend Parliament to the
utmost so long as it should be in accord with the
Commons.


The Parliament expressed itself much pleased with this
address, and in acknowledging it wished that all other
counties would follow the example of Kent.


Immediately after the King's departure from London
the Houses assumed all the powers of government : they
raised money and forces for their support, seized the
arsenals and ports, fortified London, dispatched Sir John
Hotham to be governor of Hull, where there was a large
magazine of arms, instructed the governor of Portsmouth

o i o
to take no orders but from them, placed the Tower under
the command of one of their own adherents, and passed
a Bill by which the command of the militia was entrusted
to men of their own choosing.


But there was a strong Royalist party in Kent which
was willing yet to give the King every chance and which
viewed with apprehension the decided measures of
Parliament. Many of the County nobility and gentry not
only declined to recognise the above address to the Peers
as representing County feeling, but in April, 1642,
instructed their member, Augustus Skinner, to say in reply
to the rumour that there would be disturbances at the
Assizes, that the County was in perfect peace, and that
the assertor to the contrary should be punished.


They offered the following advice in an address " on
behalf of the gentry, ministers and commonalty of the
County of Kent agreed upon at the General Assize of
that County."  
  
  
  1.—That Hull should be restored to the King.  
  
  
  2.—That the Militia question should be laid aside  
  
  
  until good law could be passed wherein care may
be taken as well for the liberty of the subjects  
  
  
  as for the defence of the Kingdom.  
  
  
  3.—Adjournment of Parliament to an " indifferent  
  
  
  place" where all might meet and discuss."
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 219 -->
  
  
Parliament resented this; Sir AVilliam Boteler and
Captain Lovelace, who had presented the address, were
detained and the chief signers of it ordered to be arrested.  
  
  
  
This, as may be imagined, did the Parliamentary cause
in Kent very little good.
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 220 -->
  
  Part IL—Charles I. 1642-1649.


Before we treat particularly of the part played by Kent
in the Civil AVar it is as well to state as nearly as possible
how the two parties of King and Parliament were
distributed.  
  
  
  For King :—AA*ere most of the greater nobles, many  
  
  
  of the lesser gentry, some rich citizens, the
townsmen of the AA'est, and the country people
generally of the North and AVest of England.  
  
  
  For Parliament :—The peers and the greater gentry,  
  
  
  the great bulk of the lesser gentry, the
townsmen of the richer part of England, the Eastern
and Home Counties, and the City of London.  
  
  
  Roughly:—For King—Aristocracy and peasantry,  
  
  
  church and universities, the world of culture
and pleasure. For Parliament — Gentry,  
  
  
  yeomanry, law, commerce and trade.


At the outbreak of the AVar, Parliament acted promptly
in Kent. Dover Castle was secured and garrisoned;
suspected royalists were arrested and their estates
confiscated, and the houses of Sir AVilliam Boteler and Sir
Edward Dering plundered. The Parliament soldiers
broke into Canterbury Cathedral, battered down the
organ, pulled up the communion rails, hacked the image
of our Lord out of the altar cloth and made a target
of our Lord's figure over the south door.


On October 23rd, 1642, the indecisive battle of Edgehill
was fought. The prayer of the Kentish knight, Sir Jacob
Astley, who commanded a battalion of the Royal Foot
Guards under Lord Lindsey, is well known :


\"O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day.
If I forget Thee, do not Thou forget me. March on,
boys!"  
  
  
  In 1643 there was a meeting of Royalists at Sevenoaks
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 221 -->
—written in contemporary documents, " Synocke."
Parliament troops under Colonel Brown were marched
thither, but finding that the Royalists had gone, learned
that they had retreated to Tunbridge. Brown went on to
Tunbridge and sent in a summons to surrender, the reply
to which was that "they stood for their ancient laws and
customs, without which they refused to lay down their
arms, but were willing to treat."


Brown pithily replied that he would come himself and
treat with them * marched on Tunbridge, and after some
stiff fighting, during which the Parliament forces were
once nearly annihilated by an ambuscade, the Royalists
were beaten and the town taken. Meanwhile some five
hundred of the " malignants " had assembled at Yalding,
and the Tunbridge people, who had welcomed the
Parliamentarians, went out and dispersed them.


At Tunbridge the Parliament General took 150 prisoners.
Evidently the Royalists in the town had expected
assistance from outside, for during the fighting the town bells
were " rung backwards." Sir George Sandys, who had
undertaken to raise Faversham, Sittingbourne, Milton,
Boughton and Rainham, was taken prisoner.


It was at this time that the churches of England
suffered such irremediable mischief at the hands of the
Puritan soldiers. The edict of August, 1643, for the
demolition of " monuments and objects of idolatry and
superstition " was followed by a still more sweeping one
in May, 1644. This ordered that all representations of
any Person of the Trinity, or angel, or saint, shall be
taken away, defaced and utterly demolished; that all
raised chancels be levelled, chancel rails removed, together
with all tapers, candlesticks and basons. No copes,
surplices, hoods, rood-lofts or holy water fonts to be used,
and all organs taken away. These orders did not apply
to images, pictures and coats of arms put up as memorials
and not as objects of veneration. The search for objects
of superstition was made an excuse for all sorts of
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 222 -->
outrages and violations of domestic life. In Sir Richard
Fogge's family chronicle there is the following entry :


\"11th July, 1644. My daur Ann died of convulsive fits
occasioned by Sir EdJ Boys, his troops comming to my house
often to search for mee and plunder mee." In this year
the commanders of the Parliament forces in Kent, being
apprised of Rupert's march towards AVorcester, were
warned to be in readiness to join Sir William AValler at
Kingston with the Militia of the five Lathes.


AVhereupou the Committee of Kent, sitting at Knole,
drew the attention of the " Committee of both Kingdoms"
to the excessive charge which the county had borne for the
levy of forces. " AA'hat we do," it says, " And what we
have done, is all out of our own purses, without any
additional help." It remonstrates that after a cost of
£2,000, Kentish troops should not be sent into other
counties and so leave the county defenceless. It resents
the imprisonment of Captain Scott because some of his
Kent men had left AValler without his knowledge, and
states, " AVe have observed for a long time a plot of the
malignants to blow up their county into a high
discontent."


However, AValler writes of the Kent men who had
joined him, " Those who are here are as gallant men and
as well provided as any I ever saw in the field, but they
have brought their mouths with them," meaning that he
was puzzled how to provide for them.


In short, there is abundant evidence that after the first
year of the war the Parliament Party in Kent was growing
weaker, and that it was with the greatest trouble that
order could be kept, much less recruits obtained. For
instance, at Horsmonden there was a gun foundry—still
commemorated in the name of the Gun Inn—kept by one
John Browne, who was ostensibly turning out munitions of
war for the Parliament. He was suspected of transactions
with the Royalist faction, called up for examination, and it
came out that Lord AA*alsingham had advised Lord Dorset
that the county was loyal, that the King should at once
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 223 -->
march 4,000 men into Kent, and that Browne would
at ten days' notice have cannon and bullet ready, the
King's people to bring bullet moulds and Browne to find
the lead. Browne, under pressure, admitted that in his
dealings with the Parliament authorities he had always
given them short weight. The last Royal stronghold to
defy the Parliament during the first Civil AVar was
Donnington Castle in Berkshire, under the command of the
Kentish Knight, Sir John Boys. From September 29th,
1644, to April, 1646, this staunch hero, with a garrison of
two hundred men, kept at bay a continuously besieging
force which sometimes numbered three thousand.


His replies to invitations to surrender are worth
quoting.


AATien Horton, the Parliament General, summons Boys
for the second time and refuses to give quarter if the
Castle has to be stormed, Boys answers :—  
  
  
  " Sir,


Neither your new addition of Forces, nor your high
threatening language shall deterremeenorthe rest of these
honest men with mee from our Loyalty to our Soveraigne,
but do resolve to maintaine this place to the uttermost of
our powers, and for the matter of quarter yours may
expect the like on AA*ednesday, or sooner if you please.
This is the answer of  
  
  
  Sir,  
  
  
  Your Servant,  
  
  
  JO. BOYS."  
  
  
  Oct. 7th, 1644.


On November 1st Horton sent an ultimatum, to which
the gallant Boys replied :


\"His Sacred Majesty had entrusted that place to his
custody, and though they w*ould give him liberty to take
whatever was in the Castle, and (if possible) to carry the
Castle it seise away, yet would he not forsake his ground,
but till his Majesty, who sent him thither, should command
him thence he was resolved to live or dye in the place."
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 224 -->

Although as yet there had been no very open, much less
united, manifestations of a change of feeling in Kent, it is
impossible to read the contemporary literature, and, above
all, the Domestic State Papers, without perceiving that the
county was a continually rankling thorn in the side of the
authorities. The pages which refer to Kent are full of
little but punishings, arrests, takings of precautions,
monitory addresses and episodes and incidents, clearly showing
that from " Foreland Point to AVesterham " the people were
fuming and setting their teeth and clenching their fists in
an unmistakable manner which boded ill for a not very
distant future.


To call this a popular feeling is to misrepresent it. The
people certainly felt deeply and bitterly, but with them
were the aristocracy and gentry almost to a man, and it is
unnecessary to say that the aristocracy and the gentry of
Kent formed a very large, wealthy and influential political
body.


At the Christmas of 1644 it was ordained by Parliament
\"that all men should keep it humbly, bemoaning the great
national sin (of feasting) which they and their fathers had
so often committed on that day." Apparently no open
opposition was made to this, but assuredly it did not tend
to bind a jovial, sport and feast-loving people to their
masters.


In 1645 Parliamentary recruiting in Kent was forcibly
resisted. Five hundred recruits halted at Sevenoaks on
their way to London, rose upon their guards, marched to
Sir Percival Hart's house at Orpington (or Lullingstone ?),
shut themselves up in it, and for some days stood a regular
siege by two troops of horse and two cannon. In April
there was a meeting held at Croydon by the Kent men who
had been pressed to serve in AATaller's army on the sore
subject of being compelled to serve away from their county,
with the result that Sir Michael Livesey's entire regiment
quietly marched themselves over the border and nobody
could stop them. Then there appeared upon the scene
the new model army, under Sir Thomas Fairfax as general,
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 225 -->
and stout old Skippon as sergeant-major-general,
consisting of 6,600 horse, 1,000 dragoons, and 14,480 foot—that
marvellous force of Englishmen which was never to know
defeat, and which, in the words of Macaulay, was to "drive
before it in headlong rout the finest infantry of Spain, and
force a passage into a counterscarp which had just been
pronounced impregnable by the ablest of the Marshals of
France."


Some of us may be Royalists at heart and like to have
a sneer at the Puritans as canting rascals who acted in
everything in the spirit which moved them to stop a sport
like bull-baiting, not because it gave pain to the bull,
as Macaulay said, but because it gave pleasure to the
spectators. But as Englishmen we can but feel a genuine
glow of national pride when we lead of the heroism and
determination of these farmers, yeomen, and tradesmen
generally against odds and against the best fighting blood
of Scotland and Europe.  
  
  
  The result was Naseby.


Even after Naseby there remained a chance for Charles.
His affairs were in irretrievable ruin; he might have
considered the deep and wide-spread suffering which his
prolonged resistance was causing, and could either have
abdicated or have fled to France.


But a bigotry closely allied to insanity hedged him
round with an immovable conviction that he could yet
emerge from the toils with dignity, that success must
eventually reward him and the faithful gentlemen who
were hazarding their all in his cause, and to the very last
he prevaricated and plotted.


It was Kentish Colepeper, one of his trustiest counsellors,
who at length lost all patience with him, and in reply to
his assertion that religion and episcopacy were coincident,
said : " Come ! the question in short is, whether you will
choose to be a king of presbytery or no king ?"


Then came the publication of his letters to the queen,
which were damning enough, and the discovery of the
Glamorgan Treaty by which Charles authorised Ormonde  
  
  
  <J
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 226 -->
to abrogate all penal laws against Roman Catholics in
Ireland, and commissioned him to coin money and to
raise men, which completed the chain of proof of his
utter insincerity.


"Many good men," says a commentator, "were sorry
that the King's actions agreed no better with his words;
that he openly protested before God with horrid
imprecations that he endeavoured nothing so much as the
preservation of the Protestant religion and rooting out of
popery, that he abhorred to think of bringing foreign
soldiers into the kingdom, yet he promised the Irish rebels
an abrogation of the laws against them, and solicited the
Duke of Lorraine, the French, the Danes, the very Irish
for assistance."


Yet this is the man whom some people still revere as a
martyr !


We now come to the Kentish rising of 1648, but ere we
enter upon an account of it it will be as well to describe
briefly the state of affairs.


The King, who had been delivered up by the Scots,
amongst whom he had sought refuge after Naseby, upon
the payment by Parliament to them of £400,000 due
for their services, and not, in all fairness to the Scots
be it said, in return for this money, had been lightly
confined at Hampiton Court, whence he had escaped, and had
gone to Colonel Hammond in the Isle of AA'ight, who
respectfully made him a prisoner in Carisbrooke Castle.


On March 20th Charles made an attempt to escape from
Carisbrooke, but found that he could not pass through the
window. On May 28th he was to have made a second
attempt, but it was frustrated by two soldiers who had
been counted upon as accomplices, and who gave timely
information to Hammond.


Many districts in England were ripe for revolt against
the dominion of the Army. The Scots, anxious to redeem
what they deemed was considered a slur upon their
national character, corresponded with Charles through the
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 227 -->
Earls of Lanark and Lauderdale, and proposed that they
should invade England, whilst simultaneous risings should
take place, not merely in the country districts of England,
but in London, hitherto the centre of the Parliament power,
where some Royalist riots had already taken place.


Warwick Castle was to be seized; Nottingham and
Oxford were to be surprised * Lancashire, Cheshire, and
North AA*ales were to declare directly the Scots crossed the
border; and Essex was ready for a rising.


Kent, as has been shown, had completely veered from
the attitude she had adopted at the commencement of the
struggle, and a very little stirring was needed to set the
combustible matter in her in a flame.


The stirring took place in the City of Canterbury at the
Christmas of 1647.


A week before Christmas the Mayor of Canterbury
published the following ordinance :


\"This is to give notice that the ordinance of the most
Honourable Parliament is to be strictly enforced; and,
whereas Saturday next is the 25th December, all persons
whatsoever in this city of Canterbury are to take heed
and remember that Christmas Days and all other
superstitious festivals are utterly abolished.


\"AVherefore all ministers and churchwardens and others
are warned that there be no prayers nor sermons in the
churches on the said 25th December, and whosoever shall
hang at his door any rosemary, holly or bayes, or other
superstitious herb, shall be liable to the penalties decreed
by the ordinance of last year, and whosoever shall make
or cause to be made either plum pottage or nativity pies,
is hereby warned that it is contrary to the said ordinance.
This is also to give notice that the usual weekly mercate
will be held in this City on Saturday, 25th December, and
all persons are required to open their shops on the said
clay."


Canterbury rose at this. Crowds swarmed through the
streets shouting, " For God, King Charles and Kent!"
The mayor knocked a man down, and in consequence was  
  
  
  «2
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 228 -->
half killed by the mob. On Christmas Day not a shop
was opened, not a stall was occupied in the market, and
not a house but had its decorations without, and its good
cheer within.


The Mayor sent for help, the citizens shut the gates, the
troops came, broke in the gates and breached part of the
walls, and, seizing the ringleaders of the riot, sent them off
in custody to Leeds Castle.


In January, 1648, a Commission sat in Canterbury
Castle to try the rioters. The Grand Jury ignored the
bill against the prisoners and persisted in so doing. Still
the prisoners were not released.


AVhereupon a Petition was drawn up; it started with
the signatures of two hundred gentlemen of Kent, and in
a very few days twenty thousand names were appended to
it, and it was arranged that on May 29th the petitioners
should assemble on Blackheath and carry the document to
London.  
  
  
  The Preamble ran thus :


"We, the Knights, Gentlemen and Freeholders of the
County of Kent, the most free people of this late
flourishing nation, by the wisdom and valour of our
Ancestors delivered from the laws of a Conqueror, and,
to these late days of unhappy confusion and distraction,
enjoying the same through all the reigns of the most
glorious, victorious Kings and Princes of this nation, do
hereby declare and manifest to all the world :  
  
  
  " 1.—That the King be admitted to treat with  
  
  
  Parliament.  
  
  
  " 2.—That the present army be paid and disbanded.  
  
  
  " 3.—That we be governed by the laws of the kingdom  
  
  
  and none other.  
  
  
  "4.—That all illegal burdens and taxes be taken off."  
  
  
  The ending of the Petition was :


\"In the mean time we shall look upon all opposition as
the provocation of a conscious and enraged Committee, and
in respect of the invasion lately made upon the persons of
our neighbours we think fit not to lie at the mercy of
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 229 -->
soldiers, but to have refuge in our arms, from which no
threats or face of soldiery shall drive us, knowing well the
justice of our cause and the temper of our own hearts."


The Committee of Kent condemned this petition and
orders were issued against all signing it.


The authorities now became really anxious : orders were
issued to prevent the Blackheath meeting and to secure
the strong places of the county, whilst the trained bands
were called out, but not twenty per cent, reported
themselves.


Further, irritated by the rumour that Parliament
intended to make an example of Kent by hanging two
petitioners in each parish, the Kent men sent up the
following bold declaration :


\"We do solemnly and religiously oblige ourselves with
our lives and fortunes to oppose effectually what persons
soever shall presume to interrupt us in the just and legal
presentment of our humble desires to the two Houses of
Parliament In case any single person shall
be for this engagement persecuted, all of us shall rise as
one man to the rescue."


The author and printer of this were ordered to be
whipped and imprisoned. Three Members of Parliament
came into Kent with a letter to the Mayor of Rochester,
explaining that there was no intention to repress festivity
by force, but only to disperse tumultuous assemblages.
But the Kent men distrusted the excuses and stood their
"round. All efforts at reconciliation failed, the
Parliao *
mentary fiat went forth that " everything should be left to
the General " (Fairfax), and the news spread from end to
end of the land that Kent was up for the King.


All now depended upon the movements of the Scots
who, it had been arranged, should act so as to draw
Fairfax's formidable army away from London. But they only
came southward in time to be completely rolled up by
Cromwell at Preston, so that Fairfax was at liberty to deal
with the Kent rising.
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 230 -->

The fleet in the Downs declared for the King, for
dissatisfaction had long been stirred up by the issuing of
Commissions without the name of the King, by the
appointment of landsmen to sea commands, and by " the
insufferable pride, ignorance, and insolency of Colonel
Rainsborough." Colonel Rainsborough, the Parliamentary
Vice-Admiral, was refused aboard his flagship, to which
he had hurried upon seeing from the shore a commotion.
About twelve ships revolted, and Cavalier Kent exulted
and sang a wild song with the refrain,  
  
  
  " For the castles on the sea

Are faithful to their King

which supplanted the older one :  
  
  
  " We shall not think our Coyne and blood ill spent,

For the glory of God, King Charles, and Kent ! "


This revolt of the fleet, which is an especially notable
event when we remember that the fleet had been generally
for the Parliament—sea-faring people being chiefly from
the Puritan parts of England—might have led to a turning
point in the Royal fortunes, but all was marred by
incapacity and want of unity amongst the chiefs. If they
had sailed for the Isle of AA'ight and rescued the King, as
they might easily have done, it is impossible to say what
might not have been the effect upon the stunned and
bewildered Royalists of England.


So they sailed over to Holland—seventeen sail now, and
took on board the Prince of AA'ales and the Duke of York,
and intrigues became rife for command, and such a medley
of silly stories ran from quarter-deck to foc'sle that the
Jacks got muddled and half wished they had never
stirred in the matter. The plan of rescuing the King was
actually suggested, but, instead of carrying it out, the
chiefs decided to sail up the Thames, which they did,
captured a few ships, which they sold to the City, and
returned to find the Parliamentary Admiral, the Earl of
AVarwick, waiting for them, and spoiling for a tight. But
the Prince and the Duke got away to Holland somehow
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 231 -->
without fighting : writers generally let Royal
Commanders down easily, if they can, and Campbell says that
a sudden shift of wind took the Royalists out of
AA7arwick's way, but more candid historians hint at
something else.


Of course. AVarwick went after them, but the Hollanders
sent deputies to pray the fleet commanders not to engage
upon their coasts, and so the matter ended, and Warwick
returned to England.


On land the Royalists of Kent seized arms ■ men were
enrolled fast and encamped on Barham Downs; Deal,
Sandown and AValmer Castles were occupied, but the
Parliament Commander at Dover refused to surrender and
prepared for a siege.


AVe can only form an idea of the intensity of passion
between the two parties at this period by examination of
contemporary diurnals and Mercuries. Not even in a
later age against the " Corsican Ogre " was poured forth
such a torrent of invective and slander as during this
part of the Civil War was poured out against Cromwell
and his party by the Royalists, and against the King by
the Roundheads. (See Note A at the end of Stewart Kent).


This warfare of the scribblers of course only reflected
the warfare of the fighters. The names of Cromwell and
his followers have been handed down as those of the
authors of indescribable brutalities and miseries, but there
is not a shadow of doubt that the balance of shame on
this score remained with the Royalists. Even in Royalist
counties, commanders like Rupert, Goring, Maurice, and
Wilmot behaved like fiends, and the excesses of their ill
disciplined followers led to associations for mutual
protection irrespective of party, like the " Clubmen" of
Wiltshire.  
  
  
  Fairfax now started on his errand.
The Royalist officers in Kent were


General, Mr. Edward Hales, utterly unfitted for the
post, but under the influence of his wife and his friend
l'Estrange, and so full of zeal that he is said to have spent
£80,000 in raising and equipping men.
<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 232 -->

Major General, Sir John Many; Lieutenant General,
Sir Thomas Peyton; and with them were Sir Robert
Tracy, Sir John Darell, Sir Richard Hardres, Sir Thomas
Palmer, Sir James Hales, Sir AVilliam Many, Sir Thomas
Godfrey, Colonel Washington, Colonel Hammond, Colonel
l'Estrange, Colonel Culpeper, Colonel Hacker, and James
Darell.


The Earl of Thanet raised men from his estates at
Hothfield, Charing, AVestwell, and Ashford, but seceded,
not from want of heart, but because he preferred a
compromise to the risk of a conflict between the yokels of
Kent and the trained battalions of Fairfax.


On May 30th the Royalists marched on London by way
of Gravesend and Dartford, but halted when they heard
that Fairfax with 7,000 horse and foot was at Blackheath.
At Dartford they received a warning from the Parliament
not to proceed with the Petition to London, and ordering
them to treat with Fairfax. This they determined to do
after consultation; Fairfax declined to treat, but advised
them that if they dispersed peaceably he did not doubt
that they would be leniently dealt with.


But from Head Quarters at Rochester came the
following defiant note to Fairfax :


\"AA'e invade not your right, but stand firm to secure
our own, which is neither tumult nor rebellion. AVe are
determined to stand and fall together, being rendered
incapable of any fear save only of relapsing into our former
slavery."


The main body of Royalists then fell back on Rochester,
which was defended by four cannon at the bridge foot, and
forty in works along the river bank.


Fairfax, in the meanwhile, advanced from Blackheath,
sent Gibbons on to relieve Dover, which was being
besieged by Sir Richard Hardres, and made towards
Rochester.


A contemporary Royalist news letter here speaks of
a great success for the King's arms : says that at Rochester
there was a stiff fight in which as many as five hundred
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 233 -->
men were killed on the Parliament side owing to the fire
kept on them by the Rainbow and Swallow men-of-war in
the river, that the Parliament troops retreated, whereupon
the Royalists sallied forth, pursued them, took twelve
cannon, arms, prisoners and carriages.


The fact is that Fairfax marched from Blackheath to
Eltham, where he passed the night, sent one wing under
Colonel Husband towards Rochester, and marched himself
vid Meopham to Mailing, where he halted.


Husband's division had some stiff fighting at Northfleet,
and especially at Gravesend, where a bridge was held by
eighty London 'prentices, sailors and countrymen, of whom
twenty were killed, many wounded, and thirty taken
prisoners. But, seeing how strongly defended Rochester
was, Husband turned southward to join Fairfax at
Mailing.


Meanwhile a Royalist force of 6,000 foot and 1,000
horse were assembled on Penenden Heath, and here a
change of command took place, the Earl of Norwich,
better known as Lord Goring—a typical Cavalier of the
period—replacing Ed ward Hales.  
  
  
  This was at noon, June 1st, 1648.


At five o'clock in the afternoon Fairfax's battalion
was seen " through perspective glasses " on the west side
of the Medway. The Royalist commander at once sent
1,000 men to guard the ford at Aylesford, and threw
3,000 into Maidstone, towards which, it was as clear as
anything* could be to an army which had not the crudest
shadow of an Intelligence Department, Fairfax was
moving.


The Parliament troops moved in excellent order :
Fairfax's proclamation against plundering or taking goods
without payment ensuring the safety of the country people,
the men being in high spirits and " every man three in
courage." With the design of turning the Royalist Left,
Fairfax had turned South from Mailing, crossed Banning
Heath, down the lane by Barming Rectory, and the
Medway at Farleigh Bridge, Norwich in the meantime
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 234 -->
remaining unaccountably inactive on the Downs by Kits
Coty House. At Farleigh Bridge and all along the river
there was skirmishing, and possibly a lane near the bridge,
called Gallants Lane, may preserve the memory of this,
but the Royalists were reserving themselves for the
defence of Maidstone, and retreated towards that town.


A stronger resistance was made in the fields at the top
of Upper Stone Street, but the Royalists always had the
worst of it, and, although the taking even of hastily
thrown up barricades cost time and life, the onward
progress of the Roundheads was steady.


There was more hard fighting at the point where the
Tovil brook runs into the Medway, and at the Len Bridge,
which then marked the limit of the town.


Two hours had been occupied in winning these two
miles from Farleigh Bridge, and it was 9 p.m. when
Fairfax prepared to storm the town.


From all accounts, of the victors and of the vanquished,
the resistance in the Maidstone streets was most
stubborn and the fighting most desperate, and it should
be borne in mind that the Royalists had but 2,000 men to
oppose to four times that number. Every house was a
fortress or a nest of sharp-shooters, barricades crossed
Stone Street at frequent intervals, and at the top of
Gabriel's Hill, where the four main streets of the town
converge, was a battery.  
  
  
  A Parliament man who took part in the affair writes :


\"The result became very questionable till almost twelve
at night. Though I have been a member of the army
ever since its first going out, and have seen desperate
services in several stormings, the like service I have not
seen before; every street in the town was got by inches,
but the Lord completed the victory for us."


At midnight the defenders, outnumbered, were driven
foot by foot into the churchyard and into the church, where,
finding that no succour could be had, they surrendered.


The losses of the Royalists amounted to 300 men slain
and wounded, 1,300 prisoners, 500 horse, 3,000 arms,
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 235 -->
eight cannon and nine colours. The Parliamentary loss in
killed and wounded was probably still greater.


The Parliament thought so much of the victory that it
ordered a thanksgiving for it in all the churches of London
anel AVestminster.


News of the fall of Maidstone did not reach the Earl
of Norwich until the next day, when, of course, it was too
late to help; indeed he had marched as far as Barming
Heath with the intention of reinforcing the troops in
Maidstone when he heard of the disaster. A Council of
AVar was held, and he determined to march on London
with his men, now about 10,000 in number. But the
passage over the Thames to the capital being refused him,
he crossed over into Essex from near Greenwich.


Fairfax's success had somewhat subdued the spirit of
the Essex men, and they were not zealous in playing the
part which had been assigned to them of acting
simultaneously with their neighbours of Kent, but Norwich
induced the country gentlemen under Sir Charles Lucas to
assemble and to muster the trained bands, and, being joined
by the Hertfordshire men under Lord Capell, the united
forces marched by Chelmsford to Colchester.


Of the famous siege of Colchester by Fairfax, who,
having disposed of Maidstone, had at once marched after
Norwich, and of its gallant defence, and the heavy
punishment inflicted upon the leaders and the town by Fairfax,
we have nothing to do.


Practically the Kentish rising ended with the capture of
Maidstone. Sir Richard Hardres, however, was still
besieging Dover Castle, but Rich and Hewson coming to
its relief the siege was raised. Canterbury, with a large
store of arms and many prisoners, surrendered to Ireton;
Deal, AValmer and Sandown Castles were closely blockaded.


Prince Charles made an attempt to relieve Deal Castle,
and landed with a thousand sailors and soldiers, but the
absolute want of generalship which had distinguished thc
Royalist military movements throughout the war was here
again manifest; the Royalists walked into the simplest of
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 236 -->
ambuscades, two hundred of them were killed, a hundred
made prisoners, and the Prince embarked in all haste,
narrowly escaping capture, and sailed with the fleet to
Yarmouth.


The personal influence of Fairfax being withdrawn, the
Parliament troops quartered in Kent were guilty of much
outrage and mischief in the county, but, as has been
already remarked, they were probably not a whit worse
than the Cavaliers were elsewhere.


Somner describes Canterbury Cathedral at this time as
looking more like a ruined monastery than a church, for
there was little left but bare walls and roof, and these
shaken and defaced, the windows were all broken, the
choir stripped and robbed of its hangings, the organ and
organ loft, communion table, screen, and monuments
defaced, rifled and robbed of brasses and iron gates. The
present font is the original which was destroyed by the
Puritans, but the fragments of which Somner gathered
and saved and had pieced together after the Restoration.


The deer in Greenwich and Eltham Parks were killed,
and the timber cut down; private residences, such as
Surrenden, Knowlton and East Sutton, were plundered,
and scarcely a parish church exists but does not show some
traces of the sacrilegious proceedings of the vehement
fanatics of this period.


It was during this year that a stranger landed at
Sandwich, giving himself out to be the Prince of AA'ales. The
Sandwich people were completely deceived by him; he took
up his quarters at the Bell, and old servants of the Prince
seemed to recognise him, although the Prince was a dark
swarthy man and this visitor was fair.


Tailors and sempstresses were set to work to make him
decent garments, "for the clothes in whieh he came were
hardly worth three pence, and he did weare a shirt as
black or blacker than his cloathes."


He then appeared in church in a suit lined with crimson
satin and laced with gold and silver; was carried round
the town in state, had many presents made to him, and in
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 237 -->
return promised all sorts of berths and rewards when he
should enjoy his own again. And all this in spite of the
facts of his complete want of resemblance to the Prince,
and that he spoke English imperfectly and in a strange
dialect.


Sir Thomas Dishington, an old servant of the Prince,
came over from Dover to see him, found him hunting duck
in the Town Haven, confronted him, called him a
counterfeit rogue, and asked permission of the Mayor to kick him.
The Prince appealed to the infatuated Mayor for
protection, and Sir Thomas was arrested, but being released
went to Dover and returned with letters from the real
Prince. The Mayor, however, refused to see the
imposition and the "Prince" was entertained at the town's
expense. Eventually he turned out to be one Cornelius
Evans, a low-bred Welshman, bornin Marseilles, and
\"well known to the police," so he was ordered into
custody.


The sentence of death upon Charles the First was read
by Broughton, clerk of the court, a Maidstone man, and
the King's body was embalmed by a Maidstone doctor.


Whether the following Petition existing in manuscript
in the Library of Crundale Rectory, and now, I believe,
published for the first time, may be accepted as evidence
that there really was a considerable Parliamentary party
in our county, or whether it must be regarded as merely a
politic stroke on the part of time-servers it is difficult to say.
It is not dated, but evidently it was just after the
suppression of the Kentish Rising of 1648.


\"To the Supreme Authority of the Nation, the
Commons of England in Parliament assembled.


\"The humble petition of the well affected in the County
of Kent.  
  
  
  " Humbly sheweth :


"That your Petitioners cannot but in all gratitude declare

hereunto we cannot but express our hearty and highest
acknowledgement of thanks to thy honourable house for
their vindicating and preserving of the just power of the
people in the late votes that declared that your legislative
power was originally in the people, and derivatively in the
House of Commons as their representative, and also for the
forwardness of thy honourable house to satisfie the just
and earnest desires of this and other counties for the
bringing of the person of the King with the rest of the
grand delinquents to a speedy Tryal.


\"And forasmuch as we are not ignorant of the plottings

The " news out of Kent," as the old papers phrased it,
during the Commonwealth is depressing reading. The
county, although sorely bent by Fairfax and his captains,
was by no means broken, and the record of this period is
just a continuance of the state of affairs in the county
after the Christmas of 1647. The country was full of
soldiers, who were as little disposed to be gentle and
forbearing towards a people who were giving them so
much trouble, as were the people little disposed to sit
down meekly under the coarse rule of men with whom
they had nothing in common but birthright.


Typical Cavaliers in every particular, the gentlemen of
Kent found it impossible to accept their defeat as the
natural issue of the struggle. " AVe were too soon "
was their cry, " Had we but waited until AA*ales and the
West and the Midlands were ready, Charles would have
been on the throne now "—the same cry which was raised
after the failure of Wyatt. For our part we do think that
the Kentish Rising was premature, but that the
postponement until other districts were equally ready would have
led to anything more substantial than a prolongation ofthe
struggle, a careful comparison between the two parties
forbids us to believe. In one respect the English civil
wars of the seventeenth century always remind us of the
Franco-German war of the nineteenth—never was such a
chance offered for genius to arise and tear victory from the
very jaws of defeat as during the Franco-German war;
yet the name of not one single French commander will be
handed down to the admiration, much less the worship,
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 241 -->
of posterity. So with the Cavaliers of our Civil AA'ar.
From 1642 to 1648 not one captain of anything more than
the most ordinary merit emerged from the mass of dashing
swordsmen in whose hands was placed the Royal Cause.


Nor was there any comparison between the rank and file
of the two armies except in the matter of animal courage.
AArithout in the smallest degree wishing to minimise the
glory of the defence of Maidstone in 1648, we do not
hesitate to say that had the positions been reversed, not
only would the Royalists never have taken Maidstone, but
they would never have been allowed to come within ten
miles of the town.


But the Cavaliers of Kent refused to accept the situation,
and so under the Commonwealth the county was
continually seething with impotent impatience and
dissatisfaction, and for this reason possibly no other county was so
hardly treated.


In 1653 a groan was raised about tythe paying, in these
terms :


\"That we, a number of poor labouring people in the
county of Kent, having been for many years before, and
during the whole time of these wars persecuted and
prosecuted to the ruine of many of our families, through
imprisonments unjust, tedious and vexatious suits at law,
and often sub-pœna'd up to London, not sparing us seed
time nor harvest, to our inexpressible prejudice by the
priests and clergy of this nation, for our refusing to pay
them tythes, though it were an equal tenth part of all the
increase of the ground, whereas indeed it is above the fifth
part, all charges, labour, losses and servants' wages being
deducted."


After the execution of Charles the Princess Elizabeth
and the Duke of Gloucester were placed in the charge of
the Countess of Leicester at Penshurst. Possibly from
some fear that their presence in the heart of a
stronglydisaffected county might be the cause of Royalist
disturbances it was ordered that they should be transferred
to Carisbrooke. This was done under the charge ofMajorit
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 242 -->
General Harrison, in two coaches each with six horses,
with plate, bedding and all necessaries, and Harrison was
strictly enjoined to use no ceremony towards them beyond
"what was fit for and due to a gentleman."


The Princess died soon after her arrival at Carisbrooke,
and as freedom of movement of the Prince was deemed as
unwholesome here as it had been at Penshurst, he was
confined to the Castle precincts, and an allowance of £1,500
a year was made him.


The domestic state papers of this period are full of
ordinances against all sports and pastimes which brought
people together in any numbers, such as horse races, cock
fighting and football, and on one occasion when the
authorities heard of a horse race to be held at Dover they
sent the Militia to stop it.


One of the greatest difficulties to be overcome by the
Government at a most critical time was the manning of
the Fleet. Although the press was at work at all times
and at all places—neither churches nor hours of divine
service being held sacred—the men pressed received their
conduct money and then refused to serve. On one
occasion fifty men were pressed at Dover, of whom twenty
came up to receive their conduct money and then refused
to go, and as the whole country was on their side their
flight was easy and their capture difficult, and this in spite
of heavy penalties imposed on householders for harbouring
runaways.


Despite this difficulty of procuring seamen it is
remarkable that at this period—as at the later and more
humiliating period under Charles the Second, presently to be
described, the Honour of the Flag at sea was strictly
insisted upon and maintained by English commanders,
and it may be noted that during this and the succeeding
period the deficiency of our seamen was somewhat atoned
for by the splendid quality of our commanders—not a few
of them military men—and our maritime supremacy
established.
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 243 -->

This high-handed principle of the maintenance of the
Honour of the English Flag in home waters—and
sometimes in very far away from home waters—is of ancient
origin. In John's reign it was ordered that if English
captains met foreigners at sea who refused to strike to the
Royal Flag they might attack them, even if the foreign
ships belonged to a friendly Power.


Edward the First insisted upon it. The Flemish
towns recognised Edward the Second's claim; Edward the
Third, as he held Calais, could assert it in the Channel.
AA*hen Philip of Spain came to marry Mary of
England, Lord AA'illiam Howard, who had to escort him,
refused to call on the Spanish Admiral until the
latter had hauled down his colours. It is said that
Howard also fired a shot across his bows, but Mr. Hume
(not David) can find no contemporary evidence for this.
Sir John Hawkins made the Spanish ships which escorted
Anne of Austria from Flanders do the same. In 1605
Sir William Monson, one of the finest of our seventeenth
century sea-dogs, made the Dutchmen off Dover strike
to the English Flag in the presence of the Spanish fleet.
Charles the First insisted rigorously on the right. In
1652 Tromp came into Dover Roads with forty-four sail.
Blake was there with fifteen. Tromp kept his flag
mastheaded. Blake hinted that he should strike it. The
tough old Dutchman replied with a broadside, the two
parties went hard at it, the bad gunnery of the
Dutchmen alone saved Blake, and by some writers this has been
deemed the origin of the first Dutch AA*ar. On this
occasion the Council of State thanked the Mayor, jurats;,
and seamen of Dover.for having volunteered to reinforce
Blake, and promised an advance of part of the £4,000
required to build their new pier.


In the same year Commodore Young fell in with a
Dutch squadron off the North Foreland. The Dutchman
declined to lower his flag, saying that if he did the
authorities at home would cut off his head. So Youn«
attacked him and gained his point.  
  
  
  r 2
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 244 -->

By the peace of 1654 it was agreed that the Dutch
should always strike flag where the English dominion was
recognised.


In 1652 the first Articles of AVar were published in the
fleet. They numbered thirty-nine, and seem to us
excessively severe, inasmuch as the penalties in thirteen cases
was death unconditionally, and in twelve others death or
a lesser punishment.


It is curious to note that during these troublous times
people had leisure to attend to witches. Thus in 1645
Joane Williford, Joan Carriden and Jane Hott were
executed at Faversham for witchcraft. In 1652 five
women from Cranbrook and one from Lenham were hung
\"for the devilish crime of having bewitched nine children,
one man and one woman, caused the loss of £500 worth of
cattle and much corn at sea."  
  
  
  Charles II. 1660-1685.


On May 25th, 1660, Charles the Second landed at
Dover. Let us quote the special reporter of the Mercurius
Piililicus on the occasion :


\"On Friday, about 3 o'c in the morning, they were
in sight of Dover, whereupon an express was sent to the
General (Monk) then at Canterbury, to hast to Dover,
which he did accordingly, and about 1 o'c came thither.
His Majesty landed about 3 in the afternoon at the Beech,
near the Peer of Dover with the Duke of York, Duke of
Gloucester and many of his nobles. Now did all put
themselves in a posture for to observe the meeting of the best of
kings and the most deserving of subjects; the admirers of
Majesty were jealous on the king's behalf of too low a
condescension, and the Lovers of Duty, fearfull on the other
side of an ostentation of merit, but such a humble
prostration was made by his Excellency kneeling, and so fitting a
reception by His Majesty kissing and embracing him that
all parties were satisfied His Majesty
walk'd up with the General, a canopy being carried over
his head and a chair of state by him towards his coach.
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 245 -->

"In his passage the Mayor and Aldermen of Dover, with
Mr. Redding, the minister, met His Majesty, and after a
short speech presented His Majesty with a large Bible
with gold clasps About two miles beyond
Dover His Majesty took horse to Canterbury." On
Barham Downs richly attired troops of horse were drawn up,
and the Kentish regiments of foot. Charles rode to the
head of each troop, which, bowing to him, kissed the hilts
of their swords and then flourished them above their
heads.


At Canterbury the Mayor, Aldermen and Recorder met
him, inflicted a speech on him, but made up for it by
presenting him with a gold tankard, value £250, and
conducted him to the Palace, where he stayed until
Monday.


\"On Monday, 28th of May," says another ' special,'
\"His Majesty came into Rochester about 5 o'c of the
afternoon, and went immediately to Colonel Gibbon his
house (built 1587: still existing and known as Restoration
House), where the Dukes of York and Gloucester also
lodged. After His Majesty had in his chamber eat
something to refresh himself, he went to Chatham to see the
Royed Soveraigne and the rest of his ships, where he gave
Commissioner Pett so much honour as to receive a banquet
from him. Thence he returned to Rochester, and about
S o'c supped. The next morning the Mayor and
Corporation presented him with a bason and ewer of silver
gilt of a good value, which was well received.


"His Majesty took his journey from Rochester about
betwixt 4 and 5 in the morning; the militia forces of Kent
lining the waies, and maidens strewing herbs and flowers,
and the several towns hanging out white sheets."


Rochester was decorated with beautiful gai lands
curiously made of scarves and ribbon, decorated with
spoons and bodkins of silver and small plate, and some
with gold chains.


At Dartford Monk's horse regiments presented the Kin"*
with an address. On Blackheath were drawn up troops
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 246 -->
of horse, and a performance of a morris dance to pipe and
tabor was given with " all agility and cheerfulness
imaginable." Several bonfires were made as the King
came along, and one more remarkable than the rest for its
bigness, where the States Arms were burned. Here the
Earl of Winchilsea presented a congratulatory address
from the nobility and gentry of Kent, and His Majesty
replied that during his journey through the county the
evidences of loyalty had been all sufficient.


\"At Deptford on the King's right hand were ranged
one hundred ' proper maids' clad all alike in white
garments, with scarves about them, who, having prepared
many baskets covered with fine linen and adorned with
rich scarves and ribbons, which baskets were full of
flowers and herbs, which they strewed before him." Done  
  
  
  into doggrell to the air " AA'hen the King enjoys his

own again:"  
  
  
  At Deptford the maidens they
Stood all in White b}* the high-way,
Their loyalty to Charls to show,
They with sweet flowers his way to strow*;  
  
  
  Each wore a Ribbin blew,
They were of cornel}* hue;  
  
  
  With joy they did him entertain
With acclamations to the skye,  
  
  
  As the King passed by  
  
  
  For joy that he receives his owne again."


Small wonder after it all, at the end of the London
reception, the Court Jeames has to record that " His
Majesty, wearied with the heat and long continued
solemnity of the day, was diverted from his pious
intention of going to AVestminster to offer up his Devotion of
Prayer and Praise in publick."


For down-right flunkeyism, hardly excusable even at
such an effervescent period as this, commend us to the two
following addresses from the Cinque Ports to the King and
the Duke of York respectively :  
  
  
  To the King.


\"That with all possible gratitude we do adore the AVise
and Gracious Providence of Almighty God in the
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 247 -->
peaceable restoration of Your Gracious Majesty to the exercise
of your kingly government within all Your Majesty's
dominions and territories and as we do upon the bended
knees of our hearts offer up our sincere thanks to God for
the same, so we earnestly implore Your Sacred Majesty to
receive this our address (though but an evening obligation
in respect of others, the accustomed time of our
convention not sooner happening) is the effect of that Duty,
Loyalty, and Subjection, which we acknowledge by the
Laws of God, Man, and Nature to owe and yield to Your
Majesty: and we do take the humble boldness to assure
Your Majesty that in the midst of the greatest defection
from Your Majesty's Government, our hearts were never
tainted with so great disloyalty, as by any address or
application whatsoever to testify our assent to any
Government imposed on us, but faithfully retained (though
forced to lie hidden in their own ashes) those lively sparks
of Loyalty, Love, and Affection towards Your Majesty as
our only Supreme Sovereign, which by Your Majesty's
happy return and presence do enliven all our hearts, and
break forth into flames, never to be extinguished, but to
be daily revived and renewed in our Supplication at the
Throne of Grace for Your Majesty's preservation and long
and happy reign over us."  
  
  
  To the Duke of York.


\"That next unto that never to be forgotten mercy of
restoring your Petitioners the breath of their nostrils and
the joy of their lives, His Sacred Majesty, their Gracious
Sovereign, your petitioners are filled with joy in the
sense of their extraordinary favor which His Majesty
hath been graciously pleased to confer on your petitioners
in granting Your Highness the office of AA'arden of the
Cinque Ports.


\"Whereby so great a door of hope is opened to your
Petitioners, that in their own thoughts they seem to be in
actual possession of their antient, but of late infringed
liberties and priviledges, and dare not let a distrustful
thought surprise their spirits, but hope that by the
<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 248 -->
interposition of Your Highness with His Majesty, His
Majesty will be pleased to confirm and renew unto your
Petitioners the Charters of the Cinque Ports, two ancient
towns, and their members, granted, confirmed and renewed
by His Majesty's noble progenitors, and also that His
Majesty will be graciously pleased to give speedy and
effectual relief to your petitioners in the several grievances
in the schedule thereunto annexed."


Most of the English counties sent up addresses of
welcome to the King, but we believe that the one
presented by the Earl of AVinchilsea on the part of the
County of Kent, was, and fittingly should have been, the
first.


The outburst of thanksgiving and rejoicing which
followed the Restoration has had no parallel in our own,
or, we should imagine, in any other country's history, until
the two celebrations of our present Gracious Queen's
Jubilees in 1887 and 1897. In its extravagance it was
absolutely un-English, but it was thoroughly English in
its genuineness. And the reason is not far to seek.
Soberminded, steady, phlegmatic as the Englishman has always
been, the yoke of Puritanism weighed heavily on the neck
of a people famous as pleasure loving, even if in foreign
eyes its manner of taking* pleasure was sad.


As we have tried to show with regard to the County of
Kent, the dominion of the Roundhead was one of
continual repression. The people put up with silly kings,
with avaricious kings, with unjust kings, even with
bullying kings, but a ruler who stopped the course of the
flowing bowl, who tabooed manly sports, who saw
crime in rustic festivals, and idolatry in church and house
decoration, it could not stand.


Directly Charles the Second set foot on Dover beach
the reins were cast loose, and the nation from Tyneside
to Lands End capered and frolicked in its revived ecstasy;
all bounds of reason and decorum were outstripped, with
the melancholy results to be told hereafter.  
  
  
  AA'e are not perhaps far wrong in attributing the
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 249 -->
disgraces which a year or two later befell our arms to the
intoxicated condition of the nation, which rendered all
order and organisation in public departments impossible.


That the operations against the Dutch in the years
1664 and 1665 were creditable to us is entirely owing to
the capacity of captains, such as Lawson, Bourne,
Spragge, Kempthorne, Ayscue, Montague Earl of
Sandwich, Jeremiah Smith, Monk, Thomas Allen, and especially
Blake, for the ships themselves were ill-manned and
illfound to a degree only credible when contemporary records
are examined.


Despite the press, there was a great dearth of seamen.
Pett, Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard, described the
recruits as "pitiful pressed creatures who are fit for
nothing but to fill the ships full of vermin."


Prisoners multiplied so that Leeds Castle was hired of
Culpeper as a receiving place, and Evelyn, who was in
charge of the work, records how he " flowed the drie
moate, made a new drawbridge, and brought spring water
into the court of the Castle." Maidstone at the same
time petitioned to have no more wounded men sent for
fear that the Plague, now raging in London, should break
out.


In the spring of 1666, Rupert and Monk, Earl of
Albemarle, with 77 ships, fought a four days' battle
against Michael de Ruyter with from 80 to 100 ships, the
scene of battle being along the Flemish coast from Ostend
to Dunkirk, and the Downs. On the first day the
English suffered severely, but showed themselves the
better fighters and manœuvrers. The second day was
signalised by the bad behaviour of some of the Dutch
captains, by the independent action of Van Tromp from
De Ruyter, and by the loss of the English Frince Royed
of 100 guns on the Galloper, being burned by the Dutch
On the third day there was stubborn fighting, Sir
Christopher Myngs and Berkeley being killed. On the
fourth day the English retreated to the river, and the
Dutch had the sea clear. Altogether we were defeated: we
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 250 -->
lost or had disabled 20 ships, and nearly 5,000 men were
killed, wounded, and missing.


The year 1667 marks the most disgraceful page in
English History. The Dutch knew that we were
completely unprepared for war. Many of our captains were
young court rakes, who took to commanding frigates as a
fashionable diversion. It was with the greatest difficulty
that men could be pressed for a deservedly unpopular
service, as much as two years-and-a-half of pay being
sometimes due to seamen, as is testified by the touching
petition of the officers and seamen of the Harp frigate
and Mary yacht for pay " that their families may not be
starved in the streets, and themselves go like heathen
with nothing to cover their nakedness."


One captain complains that for want of pay, instead of
a "young commander," he is rendered an " old beggar."
The Chatham shipwrights and caulkers marched up to
London to appeal to the Navy Board " as their families
are denied trust and cannot subsist." At Woolwich the
Commissioner said, " I am almost torn to pieces by the
workmen at the yard for their weekly pay." The caulkers
and shipwrights at Deptford " fell on the foreman of
the yard, and only by God's mercy they had not spoiled
him." The credit of the Government was nil; it was
impossible to buy stores; Commissioner Pett tried to buy
tallow and candles at Maidstone for the navy, but " found
the country so shy that, though assured of good payment,
they refused to have any dealings."


At the close of the war ships had to be kept in
Commission longer than was necessary because men could not
be discharged without being paid off. One anchorsmith
delivered goods to the value of £6,000, and only got £800
on account.


On June 9th, 1667, De Ruyter, with a carefully selected
fleet of fifty-one men-of-war, three frigates and fourteen
fire ships, appeared at the Nore, " all this," says Evelyn,
"thro'our unaccountable negligence in not setting out
our fleete in due time."
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 251 -->

On June 10th the news came that a detached squadron
of seventeen powerful ships was in the Swale, and that a
party had landed in Thanet, but had been repulsed by the
Scots soldiers there. The trained bands of Canterbury
and Sittingbourne were hurriedly called to arms and sent
towards Chatham; the beacons were fired and the country
generally put into a ferment of aimless, unordered
running to and fro, whilst reinforcements brought the
Dutch fleet up to 60 sail at the Nore, and 60 at the
Gunfleet.


The detached squadron sailed up the Thames, showing a
knowledge of the river's navigation which the English
themselves did not possess; by the first tide it reached
the Middle, landed a force on Canvey Island, burned
some houses and barns, but were driven off by the
locals; got by the second tide to within two miles of
the Lower Hope, seeing the masts of the English ships
at Gravesend, and anchored. Next morning the English
ships had disappeared higher up the river, and the Dutch
Admiral, fearful of being decoyed too far, retired to the
mouth of the Medway, and joined De Ruyter, who was
here with ten men-of-war.


Sheerness was next attacked. A miserable new fort
there was soon knocked to pieces, and the garrison fled at
the approach of the Dutch storming party of eight hundred
men, who carried off guns, stores and the flag, blew up the
rest of the fort, and returned in triumph to their ships.


At this news all was confusion and consternation in
official quarters, and a more humiliating and disgraceful
picture of sloth, corruption, inability, utter
unpreparedness, and, worst of all, cowardice, cannot be imagined
than that which is faintly drawn by the more or less
official pen of Samuel Pepys.


Monk, Earl of Albemarle, came hurrying from
London with the Guards and any troops he could pick up.
A chain was thrown across the river opposite
Gillingham, batteries were raised at Chatham, and Upnor
Castle was reinforced. Seven hulks were sunk by the
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 252 -->
chain and fireships prepared, but the forts were badly
constructed, the block-houses were of no good, for some
wanted guns, some carriages, whilst there were either
no bullets at all, or they were too big for the guns.


As for the ships which were sunk, this was done in
such a hurry that afterwards there were discovered to
have been among them the Franklin, laden with stores
for other ships, and another " hulk " with a cargo on
board her worth £80,000 !


To complicate matters further, the dockyard men
refused to work; the streets were filled with men and
women clamouring for back pay, and the officials,
conscious of having failed miserably in their duty,
shifted the responsibility and blame on to one another's
shoulders.


On June 11th the Dutch advanced up the Medway.
The Unity was attacked and captured, and a channel
being shown the Dutch, no doubt by Englishmen on
their ships, they sent fireships at the chain and broke it,
in doing which one of them went against the Matthias, set
her on fire, and she blew up. The Charles the Fifth was
taken, and the Monmouth, not liking the ugly look of
things, sailed away.


At Gillingham the Dutch landed, and behaved very well
—far better indeed than had the English soldiers quartered
in the village.


All the Dutch squadron now sailed through the gap off
Upnor Castle, the Royal Charles — a pet ship of the navy,
formerly known as the Naseby, which had brought the
King to Dover from Holland—and the Mary, which had
been left, were taken. The former might have been saved
in time, but she had no boats for towing her, it being
reported that the boats had been used by the officers and
crew for escaping ! At any rate, she was captured by a
boat with nine men; they found nobody on board, so they
struck her flag, played " Joan's placket is torn," on a
trumpet, and towed her off, but she grounded later on and
had to be abandoned.
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 253 -->

Upnor Castle kept up a brisk fire upon the invaders for
some time, but its powder failed. Here the Dutch burned
the Royed James, the Loyal London, the Royal Oak, and
the Santa Maria, the first three being 80-gun ships which
had been sunken by Monk, but showed their upper works.


Captain Douglas of the Royal Oak stuck to his ship and
perished in her, so remarkable an instance of heroism
at this degenerate period that it inspired Andrew Marvell
to write a poem entitled " The Loyal Scot."


The Dutch now retired, carrying the Royal Charles and
the Unity with them, but, as has been mentioned, the
former had to be abandoned, and, although the difficult
passage of the river was skilfully made, three of the Dutch
ships ran aground and were burned to prevent their
falling into the hands of the English. The Dutch
anchored in a line which extended from the North
Foreland to the Buoy at the Nore. "A dreadful
spectacle as England ever saw, and never to be wiped off,"
says Evelyn.


Altogether our losses consisted of five men-of-war
burned or taken with loss of life, three burned without loss
of life, and thirteen ships sunk or ashore, but not taken.


The Dutch lost all their fireships, and three men-of-war
destroyed by themselves.


The terror spread to the Capital. " The alarme was so
great," says Evelyn, " that it put both country and citty
into a paniq, feare, and consternation such as I hope I
shall never see more; everybody was flying, none knew
where or whither."


The Dutch were expected at Woolwich: the inhabitants
of Greenwich and Blackwall packed up and fled by
hundreds into the country crying " we are betrayed ! "
although the real reason for the catastrophe was the
parsimony of the ministers who had counselled the laying up
of first and second rate ships, and the carrying on of a
defensive war. More than this: incapacity and even
cowardice were rife. One English soldier-captain actually
went into action with the tompions in his gun muzzles;
<!-- Leaf 308, Page: 254 -->
ships were deserted and even set on fire without striking
a blow, and from top to bottom the Government
departments were incapable and rotten.


On June 29th the Dutch were still at the Nore.
Complaints of all kinds from all sides were poured into the ears
of the stupified, bewildered Admiralty and ordnance
officials. It was asserted that treason was rife; that there
were three thousand English and Scots seamen in the Dutch
fleet; Englishmen had been heard talking on the Dutch
ships and saying: "AVe did heretofore fight for tickets,
now we fight for dollars." Swarms of seamen patrolled the
streets declaring that they were willing to do their utmost
against the Dutch if only their tickets were paid, but
otherwise they would not venture to be killed and lose all
they had already fought for. It was asserted that those in
charge of the land defences had been acquainted with the
enemy's designs, and that in spite of all the drumming and
trumpeting there were not three hundred trained men to
defend the Kentish coast and to man the Castles of Deal,
AValmer, and Sandown.


Let us close the humiliating scene. By the Treaty of
Breda, in 1667, peace was made, De Ruyter withdrew his
fleet, after having swept the English seas for six weeks
almost without let or hindrance, and the Dutch must have
had a good laugh in their sleeves when they agreed to the
clause by which the honour of the English flag should
be respected !


The plague which ravaged London in 1665 was also
virulent in Kent, having been conveyed thither, no doubt,
by refugees from the Capital. Greenwich and Deptford
particularly suffered, and it is recorded that Eastwell House
was shut up, one house in AVestwell, and seven in
Canterbury.


In 1670 was concluded the shameful Treaty of Dover, a
secret affair conducted chiefly by the Duchess of Orleans,
sister to the King, by wliich Charles agreed to announce
his conversion to Roman Catholicism, and if any trouble
therefrom should arise in England, Louis would help him
<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 255 -->
with an army; he and Louis were to declare war upon
Holland, Louis paying Charles £200,000, and if the King
of Spain should die without an heir Charles was to back up
the French King's claim on Flanders. So in 1672 war was
declared upon Holland by England and France, and, to
show how sincere they were, the French allowed us to fight
the battle of Southwold Bay unaided, in which, although
the Dutch fleet had the worst of it and retired, we lost
two of our best captains, the Earl of Sandwich and Sir
Edward Spragge.


The naval service was still most unpopular, and to avoid
the press-gangs seamen fled from the coast and concealed
themselves in the inland towns and villages. Major Darell,
at Sheerness, writes to Secretary Williamson :—" A great
many seamen, lusty, able men, are run away from
Feversham and Milton and other maritime places into the
AA*ild of Kent." Consequently the most unsuitable men
were forced to serve. Of eighty men sent to the fleet from
Cambridge and Huntingdon, not three men were sailors,
and they often arrived on board in so filthy and ragged a
condition that the officers refused to receive them.


In this year Evelyn the Diarist paid a visit to Scotts
Hall. He went by barge from Gravesend to Deptford,
posted to Rochester, and then by coach and six to Scotts
Hall. He describes the ancestral home of this noble
Kentish family, of which eighteen generations lie buried in
Brabourne Church :


"A right noble seate, uniformly built, with a handsome
gallery. It stands in a Park well stor'd, the land flat and
good. We were exceedingly feasted by the young Knight,
and in his pretty chapell heard an excellent sermon by his
chaplaine "


Assuredly, according to the old distich, Scotts Hall has
had a fall, for all that remains of it is part of the stable
wall, close to the Ashford and Hythe road between Smeeth
and Sellinge.


Evelyn also notes the farming in Thanet as "far
exceeding any part of England for the accurate culture of
<!-- Leaf 312, Page: 256 -->
their ground, in which they exceed even to curiositie and
emulation."


Mary of Modena, the bride chosen by the Earl of
Peterboro for the Duke of York, arrived at Dover in
1673, and, unlike another royal spouse who had been
chosen by proxy, charmed her husband-elect with her
\"surpassing grace and loveliness." The Duke himself
says that he married her at Dover; Peterboro, who
would have known almost as well, says that the
ceremony took place in London. York, who knew as a sailor
how much the English people loved a show, purposely
did not hurry over the journey by Canterbury,
Rochester and Gravesend to London, so that the Kentish folk
had plenty of time to give the bridal party a good
reception, and, from all accounts, a right royal one it was.


Not so agreeable a Kentish experience was that of
another Mary, the Princess of Orange, who in 1678 was
on her return journey with her husband from a visit to
the King of England, and got stranded at Canterbury
without any money ! AVorse than this, the Corporation of
the City on being applied to for temporary assistance
declined. Dean Tillotson, however, came to the rescue,
and the future sovereigns of England stayed four days at
a Canterbury inn, having declined Tillotson's offer of the
Deanery. This must have been rather galling to the
Corporation people, especially as the gentry of Kent came
flocking in to pay their respects. This same lady had
another Canterbury experience later on.


In 1683 Algernon Sidney, son of the Earl of Leicester,
was brought to trial on account of complicity in the
Rye House Plot. He had the brutal Jeffreys as his judge,
his trial was a disgraceful proceeding throughout, and only
his high connexion saved him from having executed upon
him the whole of his horrible sentence, which was that
he should be " hanged by the neck, and, being alive, cut
down, his members mutilated and burned before his face,
his head severed from his body, which should be quartered,"
and he was simply beheaded.
<!-- Leaf 313, Page: 257 -->

Kingsgate, formerly Bartholomew's Gate, gained its
present name in this year from the circumstance of the
landing here of the King and the Duke of York.


Charles the Second built the observatory at Greenwich,
and, with the idea of having a new Placentia, that
western wing of the palace which afterwards became the
royal hospital.


AATool smuggling was carried on to an enormous extent
on the coasts of Kent at this time in consequence of the
Act of 1674, by which it was proclaimed felony to export
wool. Everybody, from highest to lowest, was concerned
in it; no place was sacred to the smugglers; the belfries
of churches were favourite store-houses or places of
temporary concealment of cargoes, St. John's Church,
Margate, Snargate, Lydd and Erith, amongst others, being
noted. In 1671 it was calculated that no less than
40,000 packs of wool had been smuggled into Calais
alone during two years.


It is interesting to note that the new iron railings
round AVren's Cathedral in London were cast at the
Gloucester furnace in Lamberhurst. AVe believe that
the Gloucester furnace itself is actually just in Sussex,
but it is near enough to Kent for our purpose. The
price was sixpence a pound and the total cost was £11,200.  
  
  
  James II. 1685-1688.


The case of Sir Edward Hales, son of the Kentish
"general " during the opening scene of the "Forty Eight,"
was important as deciding that the King had the power of
dispensing with penal laws. Sir Edward Hales was
appointed Governor of Dover Castle, but, being a Roman
Catholic, he could not take the oaths of supremacy and
allegiance under the Test Act. The King, in the usual
Stewart style, dispensed with this qualification, but public
opinion was aroused and a test action was brought against
Sir Edward, in the name of his coachman, to show cause
why he should not pay the full penalty of £500. He was
tried and convicted, but upon appeal the judges of the  
  
  
  s
<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 258 -->
King's Bench reversed the judgment, it being laid down
as law that the King had the right of dispensing with
penal laws under certain circumstances.


In 1685 the Revocation by Louis of the Edict of Nantes,
by which Henry IV. had restored his Protestant subjects
to equality with Roman Catholics, sent large numbers of
refugees into England, Hume says 50,000, and a great
many settled in Kent.


So far as our county is concerned there is nothing during
this miserable reign to detain us until the last Act. James
from the very beginning showed his resolution to enforce
his Romanist opinions, and the people were equally
determined to have none of them. The struggle ended in
the Prince of Orange being invited to come over and
assume the sovereignty, whereupon James resolved upon
flight.


On December 11th, 1688, accordingly he disguised
himself, and, attended only by his faithful Sir Edward Hales,
sneaked out of a back door from Whitehall, taking the
Great Seal with him, which he dropped into the river, and
crossed over to A^auxliall. All through the night he
travelled, and at ten the next morning arrived at Elmley
Ferry, opposite to Faversham. Here he embarked in a
custom house hoy for the French coast, but it being dirty
weather the master, requiring more ballast, put in to
shore near Sheerness.


Here Sir Edward Hales, who besides being a well-known
Papist was a most unpopular man, was recognised by a lot
of the blackguards who were constantly on the look out at
Kentish ports for refugee Papists. They boarded the craft,
robbed the King, ransacked the boat and brought it up
to Faversham.


At length a seaman recognised James, and instantly awe
of royalty overcame all other considerations, and those
who had been foremost in the work of robbery now came
forward offering to restore their plunder and to guard the
person of the worthless individual whom they regarded
still as their King, and a Kentish peasant willingly took
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 259 -->
the following note from the King to the Privy Council, or
rather, to the Earl of AA*inchilsea :  
  
  
  "Faversham, December 12th, 1688.


\"I am just now come in here, having been last night
seized by some of this town, who telling me you were to
be here this day, I would not make myself known to them,
thinking to have found you here; but, that not being, I
desire you would come hither to me, and that as privately
as you could do, that I might advise with you concerning
my safety, hoping you have that true loyalty in you as you
will do what you can to secure me from my enemies, of
which you shall find me as sensible as you can desire.  
  
  
  "James R."


The result is an extraordinary instance of the
deeprootedness of loyalty to the reigning sovereign in the
English heart. Instead of being hounded for a runaway
poltroon, as he deserved to be, James's progress to London
and through the city was almost triumphal, bells were
rung, cheers were raised, and the very people who a few
days back had cursed him were now beside themselves
with enthusiastic joy at his return.


But it was too late. The Prince of Orange was fast
advancing on London, and Dutch troops were already in
London, so that the poor man's reception was but a respite,
and on December 18th he was off again, attended by five
gentlemen and escorted by Dutch guards.


"The Englishmen were very sorrowful at seeing him
depart," says Barillon, " most of them had tears in their
eyes." Even Evelyn says :—" I saw the King take barge
to Gravesend, a sad sight! "


To us, such devoted loyalty to three such Kings as these
Stewarts seems incomprehensible, but the confirmed fact
of its existence simply shows what chances they blindly
and wickedly threw away. Even at this crisis if James
had behaved as a Tudor assuredly would have behaved,
instead of giving way to childish despair, the people would
have flocked to his standard and the Dutchmen have been
sent about their business.  
  
  
  s 2
<!-- Leaf 316, Page: 260 -->

But it was not to be. James went to Gravesend; the
next morning he was at Rochester, and remained three
days in the house of Sir Richard Head. Dundee here
counselled him to play the man and strike a blow for
himself and his kingship, but he refused. On the evening
of the 22nd he drew up a paper of moan and snivel to be
printed and published as soon as he was gone, and early
the next day he dropped down to Sheerness and sailed for
France, landing at Ambleteuse on Christmas Day.  
  
  
  AVilliam III. 1688-1702.


There is as little history connected with our county
during the greater part of this reign as in the last, and we
begin to find the history of Kent becoming more and more
merged into that of England.


In 1693 AVilliam started for Holland, and Queen Mary
accompanied him as far as Margate, his port of departure.
The weather, however, being foul, he determined to wait
at Canterbury, and so, not being expected, says Hooper,
they drove to the largest house in the city. This happened
to belong to a lady who was an ardent Jacobite, and she,
having received notice of the coming of the King and
Queen, not only took herself out of the way, but removed
as many articles of necessity and convenience as she could.


Consequently the Royal pair had to seek another lodging.
They were advised to go to the deanery, and thither they
went, and remained there for some days. The Dean
was absent, and, when the Queen returned to town, he
called to express his regret.


\"It was impossible," said the Queen, "for you to know
that I was there. Yours is the cleanest house I ever was  
  
  
  in The people were very solicitous to see me, but

there was a great walnut tree before the windows, that I
could not gratify them." She then described how on
Sunday she had gone to one of the parish churches,
and that the people stood on the Communion table to look
at her. Hooper gallantly cut down the walnut tree in
case the Queen should come again, but she did not,
<!-- Leaf 317, Page: 261 -->

Iii return for the hospitality shown her, the Queen,
observing how shabby the hangings of the Cathedral altar
were, replaced them by a magnificent cloth of rich velvet
figured with gold and silver, valued at £500.


It was on the occasion of this Canterbury visit that
AA*illiam so disgusted a local boy with his cold,
unresponsive manner. This boy gathered the flowers out of his own
garden and several mere to adorn the High Street as the
King came along, and with a number of companions ran
about two miles alongside the coach cheering
enthusiastically and crying, "God bless King William!" at wliich
the King put his hand on the glass of the carriage window
with a deprecating gesture and said, " It is enough !"


In 1694 the Queen founded Greenwich Hospital for
sailors. Hasted quotes the legal instrument : " That the
King and Queen granted to Sir John Somers, lord keeper,
and other great officers of state, eight acres of their manor
at Greenwich and that capital messuage lately built by
their Royal uncle, King Charles the Second, and still
remaining unfinished, commonly called the Palace of
Greenwich, and several other edifices and buildings
standing upon part of the aforesaid ground bounded by
the Thames, and by admeasurement along that river 673
feet, to the east end of an edifice called ' The Vestry,'
southward on the old Tilt Yard and the Queen's Garden,
and westward on the Friar's Road."


The Queen, however, did not endow the building, and it
actually remained unfinished until 1752 for want of funds,
whilst the endowment of £8,000 made by AA'illiam in 1695
was taken out of the civil list. Not to rob Mary,
however, of the credit due to her it is fair to state that she
had intended to dwell at Greenwich whilst the works were
in progress so that she could personally inspect them, that
she died shortly after her bequest, or there is no reason to
doubt that she would have made a suitable endowment.


At Hurst, on the hills near Lympne, was arranged the
Jacobite Plot of 1696, known variously as Barclay's or
Fenwick's, the object of which was to attack the King
<!-- Leaf 318, Page: 262 -->
and kill him as he was hunting in Richmond Park. The
plot was betrayed, and Fenwick tried to escape to France.
In the words of Macaulay, " The bells of all the parish
churches of Romney Marsh rang the alarm; the country
was up; every path was guarded; every thicket was
beaten; every hut was searched; and at length the
fugitive was found in bed."  
  
  
  He was beheaded on Tower Hill.


In 1698 the Czar Peter came to Sayes Court, Deptford,
then occupied by the famous Admiral Benbow, who had
leased it of Evelyn. He and his retinue wrought such
havoc in the house, and, above all, in the beautiful garden,
which had been the loving study and pastime of the
author of Sylva, that the two gentlemen memorialised the
lords of the Treasury for compensation for the injuries
done. The result was that Evelyn received £162 7s. Od.,
and Admiral Benbow £133 2s. 6d. Evelyn had been
prepared for some damage to his house. A servant wrote
to him, " There is a house full of people, and right nasty."
Loudon, His Majesty's chief gardener, the earliest
English gardener of any reputation, who had been called
to assess the damage done, thus reports :  
  
  
  1.—All the grass work is out of order and broke into  
  
  
  holes by their leaping and showing tricks upon  
  
  
  it.  
  
  
  2,—The bowling green is in the same condition.  
  
  
  3.—All that ground which used to be cultivated for

eatable plants is all overgrown with weeds, and

is not manured nor cultivated, by reason the

Czar would not suffer any men to work when the

season offered.  
  
  
  4.—The gravel walks are all broken into holes and out

of order.  
  
  
  5.—Great damages are done to the trees and plants,

which cannot be repaired, as the breaking of the

branches of the wall fruit trees, spoiling two or

three of the finest true philleras, breaking several

hollys and other fine plants.

(This last item no doubt includes the five-feet thick
holly hedge through which the barbarian genius loved to
drive the wheelbarrow with Prince Menzikoff in it.)


In the last year of AA'illiam's reign, 1701, was presented
the famous Kentish Petition to Parliament. Kent, like
other counties, was exceedingly dissatisfied with the want of
energy shown by Parliament in the granting of supplies on
the eve of a momentous war, and in general attention to
public business; but Kent, unlike other counties, resolved
to express openly what she thought.


On April 29th, 1701, the freeholders of Kent, at the
Quarter Sessions held at Maidstone, got the consent of
the Grand Jury to the presentation of the following
Petition :


"We, the gentry, Justices of the Peace, Grand Jury,
and other Freeholders, at the General Quarter Sessions at
Maidstone iu Kent, deeply concern'd at the dangerous
estate of this Kingdom, and of all Europe, and
considering that the fate of us and of our posterity depends upon
the wisdom of our representatives in Parliament, think
ourselves bound in duty humbly to lay before this
Honourable House the Consequence of this Conjuncture, of your
speedy resolutions and most sincere endeavours to answer
the Great Trust reposed in you by your county.


\"And in regard from the experience of all ages it is
manifest no nation can be happy without union, we hope
that no Pretence whatsoever shall be able to create a
misunderstanding between ourselves, or the least Distrust
of His Majesty, whose great actions for the nation are
writ in the Hearts of his subjects, and can never, without
the blackest ingratitude, be forgot.


\"We most humbly implore this Honourable House to
have regard to the voice of the people, that our Religion
and Safety may be effectually provided for, that your
Loyal Addresses may be turned into bills of supply, and
that His Most Sacred Majesty may be inabled powerfully
to assist his allies before it be too late."
<!-- Leaf 320, Page: 264 -->

The Chairman and twenty-three justices signed this,
and the freeholders of the county came in so fast to follow
their example that the parchment was filled up in five
hours.


AVilliam Colepeper (the chairman), Thomas Colepeper,
Justinian Champneys, David Polhill, and AVilliam Hamilton
were selected to present it.


They arrived in London and showed the Petition to Sir
Thomas Hales, a Kent M.P. Hales took it, promising to
return it, but showed it to other members and detained it
some time, whereupon Colepeper told him he had broken
his word and served his country very ill.


They applied to the other Kent member, Meredith, who
said that he dared not consider it as there was already a
ferment about it in the House.


In truth the House was exceedingly angry about it.
Still the Kent men determined to persevere in presenting
the Petition, and Colepeper declared "if every tile on the
chapel of St. Stephen's was a devil, he would present the
Petition; " the others stood by him, and swore they would
carry it in themselves if their representatives declined to.
So Meredith consented.


After half-an-hour the Presenters were called to the bar
of the House, and admitted the Petition to be theirs.
They were told to withdraw. Members came out and
warned them of the serious consequences of what they
were doing, and entreated them before it was too late to
throw themselves upon the clemency of the House.
Still they held out, knowing that they were within the
law, and sent answer, " AATe are humbly of opinion that
it is our right to petition this Honourable House,
according to the Statute 13, Car. II. As to the matter of our
Petition, we declare that we intend nothing offensive to
this Honourable House;" but they refused to add that
they were sorry,—" because we will have no ' sorry.' "


After five hours' debate the Petition was declared
scandalous, insolent, and seditious, and the presenters were
ordered into custody.
<!-- Leaf 321, Page: 265 -->

At first they were well treated, and AA'illiam Colepeper
was allowed to go to Hollingbourne to comfort his wife,
but afterwards the four gentlemen were separated and
rigorously confined. Colepeper and Champneys were shut
up in a wretched garret in Fox Court, Holborn; Polhill
and Hamilton in a cellar so vile they could hardly
breathe; all were bullied by the Serjeant who had the
custody of them.


Thinking to make their conditions worse the Serjeant
complained that his prisoners behaved so disorderly that
he feared a rescue; but this complaint turned out to their
benefit, for they were removed to the Gate House, where
they were well treated.


Then came the presentation to the House of a petition
still more violent than the original, and known as the
Legion Paper (See Note B at the end of Steivart Kent), by,
it is said, Daniel Defoe, disguised as a woman, and escorted
by sixteen lords. This so alarmed the anti-Petitioners that
the whole matter was dropped, and after prorogation the
prisoners were released.


They instantly became popular idols, and were regarded
as martyrs in the public cause. The Mercers' Company
feasted them before their departure for their homes, and
their progress through Kent was one triumphal procession.
At Blackheath, where Polhill left them to go to Otford,
500 horse met him and escorted him home. The other
three went on to Rochester, where they were met by
horsemen from all parts of the county, " so that all the
inns could not entertain them."


Four miles from Maidstone, on Boxley Hill, the people
met them. At Sandlin, two miles further, the gentry of
the entire neighbourhood came in their coaches, attended
by an enormous crowd. They entered Maidstone in
triumph, " with such exclamations as had never been seen
in the place since the Restoration; " and all night bonfires
blazed and healths were drunk; the Grand Jury, of
which twelve were justices of the Peace, publicly iu a
body thanked them.
<!-- Leaf 322, Page: 266 -->

At Bearsted all the countryside was assembled; bells
rang, and all night the crowd waited for Colepeper,
intending to escort him to Hollingbourne, but the
extraordinary reception at Maidstone had delayed him so that
he passed the night there.


That this Kentish remonstrance against the waste of
time by Parliament, and its lethargy in the business of
putting the nation ready for the crisis at hand—a crisis
which produced the AA*ar of the Spanish Succession—was
not without just cause appears likely from the following
letter, bearing upon the national unreadiness for war,
written at this time by a Gentleman of Kent, either to
the Earl of Godolphin, Lord Treasurer, or to Henry Boyle,
Chancellor of the Exchequer :


\"Upon peril of my head I would undertake, old as I
am, to land with about 20,000 foot and 2,000 dragoons on
next Monday morning in any part of Kent or Sussex,
from Dover to Chiehester, and quarter my troops in
London, Westminster, and Southwark, by Saturday next,
so as to hear High Mass on Sunday morning at Saint
Paul's, and dissolve your Parliament on the Monday
following."


The Bishops' Palace at Bromley was the scene of the
discovery of the so-called Flower Pot Plot against the
Prince of Orange. The name of Bishop Sprat, of
Rochester, was affixed to a paper containing the details of
a plot for the restoration of James IL, which paper was
placed in a flower pot, so that it might be found by
Government spies. Sprat was arrested and kept in
confinement for a short time, but no proofs of his guilt
being produced, he was released.  
  
  
  SUNDRIES OF THE STEAVART PERIOD.


Mrs. Hutchinson, the noble wife of the noble Puritan
Colonel Hutchinson, thus speaks of James the First and
the influence of his vile court at Greenwich :


\"The honor, wealth and glory of the nation, wherein
Queene Elizabeth left it, were soone prodigally wasted by
<!-- Leaf 323, Page: 267 -->
this thriftlesse heire, the nobillity of the land utterly
debased by setting honors to publick sale, and conferring
them on persons that had neither blood nor merritt fitt
to weare, nor estates to beare up their titles, but were
faine to invent projects to pill (pillage) the people, and
pick their purses for the maintenance of vice and
lewdnesse. The generallity of the gentry of the land soone
learnt the court fashion, and every greate house in the
country became a sty of uncleannesse. To keep the
people in their deplorable security, till vengeance overtook
them, they were entertain'd with masks, stage playes
and sorts of ruder sports. Then began murther, incest,
adultery, drunkennesse, swearing, fornication and all sorts
of ribaldry, to be no conceal'd but countenanc'd vices;
because they held such conformity with the court
example.


\"And now the ready way to preferment there was to
declare an opposition to the power of godlinesse, under
that name; so that their pulpits might justly be called
the scorner's chair, there sermons only pleasing that
flatter'd them in their vices, and told the poore King
that he was Solomon ! that his sloth and cowardize, by
which he betray'd the cause of God and honour of the
nation, was gospell meeknesse and peaceablenesse, for
which they rays'd him up above the heavens, while he lay
wallowing like a swine in the mire of his lusts. He had
a little learning —and this they call'd the spirit of
wisedome, and so magnified him, so falsely flatter'd him,
that he could not endure the words of truth and
soundnesse, but rewarded these base, wicked, unfaithfull
fawners with rich preferments, attended with pomps and
titles."


Charles the First as a King was despicable, but at any
rate he was a gentleman, and his court was pure. Of him
Mrs. Hutchinson says :


\"The face of the court was much chang'd in the change
of the King, for King Charles was temperate, chast and
serious, so that the fools and bawds, mimicks and
<!-- Leaf 324, Page: 268 -->
catamites of the former court grew out of fashion; and
the nobility and courtiers, who did not quite abandon
their debosheries, had yet that reverence to the King
to retire into corners to practise them. Men of learning
and ingenuity in all arts were in esteeme, and receiv'd
encouragement from the King, who was a most excellent
judge and a greate lover of painting, carvings, gravings
and many other ingenuities, less offensive than the
prophane abusive witt, which was the only exercise of the
other court."


Jeffrey, in the Edinburgh Review; thus speaks of the
grossly exaggerated portrait of the Puritan which has
been handed down to us :


\"Instead of a set of gloomy bigots waging war with
all the gaieties and elegancies of life, we find ladies of
the first birth and fashion at once converting their
husbands to anabaptism, and instructing their children in
music and dancing,—valiant Presbyterian colonels refuting
the errors of Arminius, collecting pictures, and practising,
with great applause, on the violin.—stout esquires, at the
same time praying and quaffing October with their godly
tenants,—and noble lords disputing with their chaplains
on points of theology in the evening, and taking them out
a-hunting in the morning.


"There is nothing, in short, more curious and instructive
than the glimpses which we here catch of the old hospitable
and orderly life of the country gentlemen of England
in those days when the national character was so high
and so peculiar, when civilization had produced all its
effects but that of corruption, and when serious studies
and dignified pursuits had not yet been abandoned to a
paltry and effeminate derision. LTndoubtedly, in
reviewing the annals of these times, we are struck with a loftier
air of manhood than presents itself in any after era."


The list of famous Kent men during this period is not
long. Harvey, discoverer of the circulation of the blood,
may fairly occupy the first place. He w*as born in
Folkestone, was chief physician to James I. and Charles I.
<!-- Leaf 325, Page: 269 -->
and published his famous treatise in 1628. Many other
important works by him were destroyed in the wars.


Sir Richard Baker, whose chronicle of the Kings of
England is so valuable to historical students, was a
Sissinghurst man. Lovelace, the cavalier poet, was born at
Woolwich, but the family seat was near Bethersden,
where a farmhouse called Lovelace still marks the site.
It was whilst imprisoned in the AA'estminster gatehouse
for having been one of the presenters of the Kentish
Royalist Petition of 1642 that he wrote the lyric to
Althea, in which are the oft-quoted lines :  
  
  
  " Stone walls do not a prison make,  
  
  
  Nor iron bars a cage;  
  
  
  Minds iunocent and quiet take

That for an hermitage."


Edmund Waller, the turncoat poet, who wooed Lady
Dorothy Sidney under the name of Sacharissa, was of a
Kentish family, as was Sir Hardres AA'aller, the somewhat
distinguished Parliamentary commander.


Grinling Gibbons, if not Kent born, was at any rate
unearthed in Kent, near Sayes Court, Deptford. Of the
illfated Algernon Sidney and of Sir Dudley Digges we have
already spoken. Sir Heneage Finch, who occupied various
high positions under Charles IL, is famous chiefly as
having been'the Anni of Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel,
and for his oratory was known as the " English Cicero "
and " Roscius."


Will Adams, the first Englishman who landed in Japan,
was a Gillingham man. In 1600 he was chief pilot to the
Dutch fleet which annually went to Nagasaki in the
service of the Dutch East India Company, and when out
there won the favour of the great Shogun Iyeyasu,
who employed him as a ship-builder and even as a
diplomatic agent, and raised him to high honour.
Prevented from returning home, Adams married a Japanese
girl and settled down as a naturalised subject of the
Emperor.
<!-- Leaf 326, Page: 270 -->

The writer was living in Japan when his friend Walters
discovered on a charming hill near what is now the busy
dockyard of Yokosuka the tombs of this Kentish exile
and his wife. The tomb of Adams is uninscribed, but
that of his wife bears the usual Buddhist posthumous
name. The view from the tombs is one of the most
lovely on this coast of lovely views.


It was during this period that Wrotham in Kent became
famous for its pottery. The earliest dated specimen is
1612, the latest 1710. It was known as the "Slip
decorated ware," and consisted of coarse, reddish clay,
upon which a " slip" of thin creamy mixture of clay
and water was allowed to trickle through a small tube,
producing all sorts of fanciful and quaint designs. On
this a glaze of sulphuret of lead, often mixed with
manganese, was applied before firing, which gave a rich
yellow tone and transparency. The principal articles of
Wrotham ware are " tygs "—cups used by all the guests
in common before the introduction of separate drinking
vessels, with double and triple handles; posset cups,
jugs, plates, dishes, candlesticks and cradles intended
for gifts. Jull was the great Wrotham potter, and the
site of his manufactory is still pointed out. The
drinking vessels generally had mottoes on them, such
as " Be merry and wise," " The best is not too good
for you," " Obeay the King;" "Brisk be to the med
you desier, as her love you may require; " " Com, good
weman, drink of the best, John, my lady, and all the
rest."  
  
  
  NOTES ON STEWART KENT.  
  
  
  A.


Here are samples of contemporary Kentish verse—that is to say,
verse of whieh Kent is the subject. From the Mercuriim Piiblkus,
May 22nd-29th, 1648.
<!-- Leaf 327, Page: 271 -->
  
  " Courage, Courage, brave soules, and now revive
Your country'8 ancient glory, may you thrive,

In enterprise of equall honor may your name
Stand fair with theirs in the monuments of fame.
May you unconquer'd still remaine ! Tread downe

The Common Foe, and help the King to the erowne :

May after ages say thus : Noble Kent  
  
  
  
Gave the great'st blow to that curs'd Parliament!"
A Kentish Cavalier song :  
  
  
  " Kentish men, keep your King,  
  
  
  
Long swords and brave hearts bring;
Down with the rebels and slit their crop ears !  
  
  
  
Hell now is wanting rogues,

Send there the canting dogs,
Ride to the scurry, my Kent cavaliers !

God and our King for grace,

Leave now your wives' embrace,
Up and avenge all their insults for years !

Ironsides! Who's afear?  
  
  
  Pack 'em to Lucifer,  
  
  
  Ride to the scurry, my Kent cavaliers !"
Then there is Browning's swinging chaunt :  
  
  
  " Kentish Sir Byng stood for hia King,
Bidding the crop-headed Parliament swing,
And pressing a troop unable to stoop
And see the rogues flourish and honest folks droop,  
  
  
  Marched them along,  
  
  
  Fifty score strong,  
  
  
  
Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song ! "
This is a typical morsel :  
  
  
  Look to your eyes, War Kite, I say,
You carren Parliament,
For yet before Midsummer Bay

Your houses shall be rent.
All loyall hearts now join with Kent,  
  
  
  
And revenge Surrey's wrongs;
Come, all you counties with intent  
  
  
  And thrash them with your prongs !"  
  
  
  B.


The "Legion Paper" was addressed to the Speaker, and was
accompanied by the following—well, threatening letter :  
  
  
  " Mr. Speaker,


'' This memorial you are charged with in behalf of many thousands
of the good people of England. There is neither Popish, Jacobite,
seditious, court, or party interest concern'd in it; but honesty and
<!-- Leaf 328, Page: 272 -->
truth. You are commanded by two hundred thousand Englishmen
to deliver it to the House of Commons, and to inform them that it
is no banter, but serious truth, and a serious regard to it is
expected; nothing but justice, and their dut}7, is required, and it is
required by them who have both a right to require and a power to
compel, viz : the people of England. We could have come to
the House strong enough to oblige them to hear us, but we
have avoided any tumults, not desiring to embroil, but to save
our native country. If you refuse to communicate it to them you
will find cause in a short time to repent it."


The claims of the Petition, if so dictatorial a composition can be
called a Petition, were that the people had a perfect right to
censure and direct their representatives in Parliament: that the
House of Commons has no separate right to suspend the laws of
the land : that the House has no power to imprison any person
except its own members.  
  
  
  The " Petition" concluded thus:


\"Thus, gentlemen, you have your duty laid before you, which,
it is hoped, you will think of; but if }*ou continue to neglect it you
may expect to be treated according to the resentment of an injured
nation; Englishmen are no more to be slaves to Parliaments than
to Kings. Our name is Legion, and we are many."
<!-- Leaf 329 -->
  
  VIII.—EIGHTEENTH CENTURY KENT.

PS we approach modern times we find that naturally
the history of a county becomes more and more
merged in that of the country generally, and
this is the reason for the course we shall now pursue to
the end of this work, of dealing seriatim with the
principal events touching the county of Kent without
any arbitrary divisions into reigns.


The great storm of 1703—that alluded to by
Addison—"such as of late o'er pale Britannia passed"—
was most disastrous on our Kentish coasts. Schomburg
says that thirteen men-of-war were destroyed, and 1,519
seamen drowned. Sandwich suffered to the extent of
£3,000, and we know that Deal, Ramsgate and Margate
were stricken in proportion. The Downs, at the time
when the gale burst, were crowded with shipping, and
upon the Goodwins drove the full force of the
southwesterly wind. So fierce indeed was the blow that ships
actually sank at their anchorages. Sir Cloudesly Shovel,
however, with eight sail of the line, managed to weather
it, although, of course, at a vast loss of masts and rigging.
Amongst the men-of-war lost were the Mary (60),
Northumberland, Restauration and Sterling Castle, each of
70; and of all their crews only 80 men were saved.


In 1722, Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, was engaged
at Bromley Palace, together with the Earls of Arran and
Orrery, and Lords Lansdowne, North and Go wer, in a
Jacobite Plot. Their design was to get a force under the
Duke of Ormonde to land on the South Coast, whilst  
  
  
  i
<!-- Leaf 330, Page: 274 -->
Atterbury and his friends got possession of the Tower, the
Bank and the Exchequer Office, and James the Second
should be proclaimed simultaneously all over the country.
But the French Government gave information of the
preparations to the British authorities; Atterbury was
arrested and sent to the Tower, sentenced to deprivation
of all his ecclesiastical offices, and to perpetual
banishment.


The middle of the Eighteenth Century marks a low
point in our National History. The spirit of the people
seemed to be absolutely dead, the upper classes abandoned
themselves to frivolity and vice, the lower classes were
hardened and brutal to a degree only to be appreciated by
a study of the contemporary newspapers. A startling
instance of this temporary degeneracy is afforded by the
apathy and indifference with which the movements of the
Pretender in 1745 were regarded by all classes of English
society, until the advance to Derby caused a contemptible
and disgraceful panic in the City of London, only once
before or after paralleled in our history.  
  
  
  " England," wrote Henry Fox, " is for the first comer.  
  
  
  If 5,000 French had landed in any part of

this island a week ago, I verily believe the entire conquest
of it would not have cost them a battle!" Another
writer speaks of the "Forty Five" thus: " Those of anv
rank above a constable, instead of arming themselves and
encouraging the people, generally fled before the rebels,
while a mob of ragged Highlanders marched unmolested
to the heart of a populous Kingdom." And this was not
from sympathy with the Pretender's cause, for the feeling
against it was very strong.


Yet we may note that it was in 1740 that were
composed " God save the King," " The Roast Beef of Old
England," and " Rule Britannia," and in 1759—the year
of Granby's, Hawkes' and AVolfe's glories at Minden,
Quiberon Bay and Quebec—was written " Hearts of Oak."


Kent, however, was held in readiness in case the
Pretender's adherents should attempt a landing from
<!-- Leaf 333, Page: 275 -->
France; and a general levy of all capable of bearing arms
was arranged for, the rendezvous being Barham Downs.
Admiral Vernon sent a warning to the Governor of Deal
Castle to be ready for an invasion of Irishmen, whereupon
the Deputy Lieutenant of the County issued a
proclamation calling upon all able men to assemble the next day
upon Swingfield Minnis, near Dover; all parishes within
twenty miles of the coast were to send well armed men,
and the men of the immediate neighbourhood were to
bring intrenching tools. So well did the people respond
that at the appointed time there were two thousand
wellarmed men assembled.


Smuggling was the chief industry of Kent at this
period. In spite of severe penal laws the clandestine
export of wool was enormous and continued until 1793.
In 1743 "Riding Officers " were appointed for Romney
Marsh, whose especial duty it was to look after the
\"owlers " as the wool smugglers were called.


So long as the smugglers stuck to their own trade the
sympathy of all classes in the countryside was with them,
but when, encouraged by their success and the futility of
the Preventive service, they became mere robbers, Society
awakened to the existence of a terrible tyranny in its
midst, and took measures accordingly. Such paragraphs
as the following, taken from the " Gentleman's Magazine "
for 1745, were common in all contemporary journals :


\"At Folkestone a body of smugglers enter'd the house
of Mr. Jordan, a custom house officer, arm'd with carbines
and pistols, destroy'd his goods, and carry'd off his plate,
but one of them, who had ruffles, was shot dead."


\"At an ale house at Grinsted Green, Kent, a gang of
twelve or fourteen smugglers assaulted three Custom House
officers, wounded them in a barbarous manner, and robb'd
them of their watches, money, and other things of value."


\"Some smugglers enter'd the house of a farmer near
Sheerness and plunder'd it of 1,500 pounds of wool."


Ransley's gang, the exploits of which are commemorated
in G. P. R. James's novel, "The Smuggler," were men and  
  
  
  i 2
<!-- Leaf 334, Page: 276 -->
women principally from the villages of Bonnington,
Bilsington, and Aldington, and their operations lay in
the country between Sandgate and Dungeness. Legends
of their brutality still linger in the neighbourhood,
especially of their cruel attack upon a poor old woman at
Ruckinge. The gang was broken up by the ' treachery '
of one Spratford, and the grave of Quested, the biggest
blackguard, who was hung, may be seen at Aldington, in
which village there is still a Ransley living. But the chief
pest in the Weald was the Hawkhurst gang, which
flourished until 1747, when the people of Goudhurst
leagued themselves together for mutual protection, calling
themselves "The Goudhurst Band of Militia." Between
them and the smugglers a regularly arranged encounter
took place, which terminated actually in the storming of
Goudhurst church, whither the smugglers had been driven,
during which three of the latter were killed, many
wounded, and the rest dispersed. So famous was this
Hawkhurst gang that it was hired by the Dorsetshire
smugglers in order to recover a valuable cargo of two tons
of tea and 39 casks of spirits which had been captured
from them by the Preventive men and lodged in Poole
Custom House. The attack was made, the goods recovered,
and two men, suspected of being informers, killed. I give
the sequel in Mr. Furley's words :—


\"Being betrayed by one of their gang a special
Commission for the trial of seven of the murderers was held at
Chiehester in January, 1748. They were convicted and
executed the day after their trial, except one, who died
within a few hours of his conviction. Apprehensions,
trials and convictions of other members of the gang
followed. Some of the Hawkhurst gang, including
Captain Kingsmill and his second in command, AA'illiam
Fairall, aged twenty-eight, born at Horsendown Green in
Kent, who described himself ' of no business, but inured to
smuggling from his infancy,' were not tried until 1749,
when they were indicted at the Old Bailey for breaking
into the Custom House at Poole. One of the accomplices
<!-- Leaf 335, Page: 277 -->
at the trial stated that the Hawkhurst gang were called
the ' East Country People.' 'There were 31 horses and 30
men of us; the odd horse belonged to the East
countrymen and carried their arms.' "


Another witness said, "Some had pistols, some had
blunderbusses : all the Hawkhurst men had long arms
slung round their shoulders."


Three of them were hung at Tyburn; Kingsmill's body
was hung in chains on Goudhurst Gore, Fairall's on
Horsendown Green. Four more of the gang were
afterwards hung for highway robbery, after having been
rescued from Newgate by brother smugglers. Later still,
four more were executed on Penenden Heath for
housebreaking and horse-stealing, and so this particular gang
was broken up, although the business continued to flourish
until well into the next century.


In 1759 our Kentish hero, General AA*olfe, was killed at
the storming of the heights of Abraham before Quebec. I
subjoin literally a letter from a Louisburg Volunteer who
was present at the last:


\"When the General receved the Shot I Caut hold of
him And Carried him of the Feild : he AValked About one
Hundred yards And then beged I would Let Sit Down,
which I Did. Then I Opened his Breast, And found his
Shirt full of Blood At AVhich he Smiled, And AVhen
he Seen the Distress I AVas in, My Dear, Said he, Dont
G rive for me. I Shall be Happy In a Few Minutes : take
Care of your Self As I see you are Wounded. But Tell
me O Tell me How Goes the Battle Their. Just then
Came some Officers AVho told him that the Freinch had
given Ground and Our troups AA'as pursuing Them to
the AValls of the town, he AA*as then Lying in my Arms,
Just Expirin Raised himself up on this
News And Smil'd in my Face. Now, Said he, I Die
Contented, from that Instant the smile never Left his
Face till he deided."  
  
  
  From 1766 the American AVar occupied the attention of
<!-- Leaf 336, Page: 278 -->
people exclusively, and it is remarkable how general the
feeling was against it, especially in Kent.


In 1778 there was a large Camp of Regulars and Militia
on Coxheath, about which we get some interesting details
from contemporary newspapers. For instance, we find the
prices of provisions as supplied to the soldiers :—Beef and
mutton 4 pence a pound, bacon 6 pence, Cheshire cheese
4 pence, butter 8 pence, peas and beans 2 pence a peck.
Complaints from the smugglers are heard that the vicinity
of this wild Heath (whence is obtained one of the finest
views in the county), once a happy hiding place for their
goods, is now, owing to the existence of the Camp, no longer
so, as the goods hidden in woods and hedges are stolen by
the soldiers.


Duelling seems to have been so prevalent amongst the
officers that most stringent regulations against it were
issued from head-quarters, but without effect.  
  
  
  On November 5th, 1778, a Royal Review was held

here.


\"Their Majesties arrived at Montreal, escorted by a
large body of the inhabitants of Sevenoaks and
neighbouring places, wearing in their hats cockades of oaken boughs,
the emblem of the moving woods before AVilliam the
Conqueror and their unconquered state. The whole county
concurred in giving them a hearty welcome 

They stopped at Queen Elizabeth's Free School at
Sevenoaks, where an elegant Latin oration was delivered to the
honour of the Men of Kent. It was allowed by their
train that their Majesties were never received with
greater, if they have with equal, respect and attention
as they have been here in any tour they have made."
Coxheath was enclosed early in the present century, and
all that remains to tell of the Aldershot of our
grandfathers is the old Clock House, which used to be officers'
quarters.


In this year the great Earl of Chatham died at Hayes
Place, where in 1759 had been born his equally illustrious
son, AVilliam Pitt.

The Canterbury silk industry was in a sad condition at
this time. Only one-third the number of hands were
employed, which meant that £4,000 a year was now only
circulated in the city instead of £12,000 as formerly. The
weavers petitioned the ladies of England to patronise them
instead of buying printed, painted, stained and dyed
\"callicoes," and even hinted pretty broadly that it was
illegal to do so, quoting in support of their assertion the
Act 7 George I., by which the wearing of such calicoes
was forbidden under penalty. But the trade was doomed.
AVhereas in 1719 there were in the City of Canterbury 334
looms, 58 master weavers and 51 apprentices, in eighty
years the number had dwindled to some ten master
weavers, and we may suppose that one of the last big
orders which the Kentish silkmen got was in 1789 for
the silk used in the decoration of the Prince of AVales's
magnificent Carlton House.


The transfer of silk weaving to Spitalfields really ruined
the Kentish trade.


So with the Kentish broadcloth manufacture and that
of baize. Scotland and the Yorkshire and Lancashire
towns were coming to the fore in this industry by leaps
and bounds, so that by the end of the 18th century, says
Hasted, there was not a manufactory left in the Weald,
although a worsted establishment at Hawkhurst was
carried on for a few years later.


The Kentish iron trade had never been important when
compared with that of Sussex; still, one little corner of
our county had been a busy hive of grimy industry for
many centuries. In 1740 there were 60 furnaces at work
in England, of which Sussex owned 10 and Kent 4;
the output respectively was 1,400 and 400 tons. In
1796 there were 104 furnaces in England, not one in Kent
and only two in Sussex—the Ashburnham, which was
only "blown out" in 1809, and one near Rye, which was
kept on until 1825.


In the place of these good old industries the active,
restless men of Kent followed two callings in particular
<!-- Leaf 340, Page: 280 -->
of questionable morality, although the fact cannot be
disguised that contemporary, aye and modern, sentiment was
all in their favour. As smugglers and as privateersmen
the men of the coast throve exceedingly, and, as a
natural consequence, the effects of their prosperity were
manifest amongst not only the country folk generally, but
the yeomen and gentry. People embarked their money in
a " run," or in a privateer, just as they do now in stocks
and shares, and there was an element of risk and
adventure about both which gave the speculation a
peculiar zest.


The following are samples of advertisements which
appeared in all the newspapers during the French wars.
These are taken from the Kentish Gazette of 1778 :  
  
  
  " For a Six Months' Cruize

\"Now fitting out at Dover and will sail with the utmost
expedition, the Active privateer, 224 tons burthen,
mounting 18 six pounders, swivels, etc., in proportion.  
  
  
  AA*illiam AVatson, Commander,

So well known for his extraordinary success during the
late war, and the short period of time in which the prize
money was shared. All able and ordinary seamen,
landsmen, etc,, desirous of trying their fortunes in the said
cutter, let them instantly repair, etc. It is unnecessary
to inform a seaman what must be the advantages of such
a cutter at the commencement of a French war. The
commander is determined to distribute the prize
moneywithin one month after the condemnation sale, and the
receit of it. A weekly allowance will be made for the
support of the families of the seamen belonging to the
above vessel."


From subsequent announcements it would seem that
those who-embarked in the Active had plenty of fun, and
that those who invested in her had no reason to be
disappointed.  
  
  
  This is another :


"All gentlemen sailors and able-bodied landsmen who
are willing to enter on board the Joseph Privateer, a prime
<!-- Leaf 341, Page: 281 -->
sailer, carrying 12 carriage guns, and ready to proceed on
a cruize against our enemies, will meet with due
encouragement by applying," &,c.


As for the smugglers, the more stringent duties on
imports gave a tremendous spur to their energy. By the
law of 1779 a shipmaster from any country except the
East Indies was liable to a fine of £300 if more than one
hundred pounds of tea, or more than one hundred gallons
of foreign spirits in casks, were found on board his vessel.
Dealers in tea, coffee, chocolate, and spirits were obliged
under heavy penalties to have the fact announced on their
shop fronts. French wines, rum, and brandy paid £1 per
gallon duty. All lace goods had to bear the Government
stamp as a proof that duty had been paid upon them, and
imitation of this stamp was punishable by a fine of £200.
At the end of the century tea was twelve shillings a pound,
even after much of the duty had been taken off and put
on windows, so that it was quite customary for guests at
tea parties to bring their own tea with them.


So smuggling went on apace all round our Kentish
coasts, and hardly a newspaper was published without
some paragraph concerning a fight between smugglers and
Preventives, like the following :


\"Rowley, a riding officer of the Customs, met a gang
of smugglers near Sevenoaks, Kent, but the night being
exceedingly dark the Dragoons separated from Rowley and
three of his servants, the latter of whom engaged with the
smugglers, who were armed with cutlasses. The affray was
desperate. Seven of the smugglers, after being horribly
mangled, deserted their horses and goods without any
material hurt to their antagonists, save the loss of a cheek
by one of the officers' servants."


Nor was the fun of the contraband trade confined to
the coast and the by-roads. Here are two stories from
"Baily's Magazine" in connection with the old Dover
Road :


An announcement appeared in the papers that an
English lady, wife of a celebrated foreigner, had died
abroad, and that her body was to be brought home for
<!-- Leaf 342, Page: 282 -->
burial. The coffin duly arrived by packet from Calais and
was met at Dover by a hearse with six horses, and two
mourning coaches with four, all decked with the orthodox
trappings and plumage. Slowly and with befitting
solemnity the funeral procession passed out of Dover on
its way to London, just at the time that the Preventive
authorities had learned that a great shipment of lace
might be looked for. Of course the lace was in the coffin.


On another occasion the authorities knew that a large
lot of lace had been landed at Dover, but all scent of its
whereabouts was lost, until it was w*hispered at
headquarters that a special order had been received by a Dover
inn for a post chaise to be in waiting at a point outside
the town to take a single gentleman with a portmanteau,
and ready to make a fast journey.


The officers made their plans, and accordingly at the
named time a post-chaise dashed through Dover on the
road to Canterbury as fast as four horses could lay hoofs
to ground, and after it sped the officers.


At Canterbury they arrived a few minutes after the
suspected chaise had left; they followed it through
Faversham, Sittingbourne, Rochester and Gravesend. Here
they met the return night heavy coach which travelled
slowly.


\"Seen a post-chaise and four pass you 1" asked the
officers of the old driver.


"Yes," replied he, "And one of their last change horses
was lame, so you may catch them."


Off they went, and found the chaise at Deptford. The
passenger was having supper. In walked the officers, and
found a quiet, gentlemanly man who asked them their
business.


"We must search your carriage in the King's name,"
they replied. " Search, and be d d," said the passenger.
AA'hich they did, and found nothing.


All the time the lace was in the slow night coach, the
fossil driver of which was, of course, a confederate of the
smugglers.
<!-- Leaf 343, Page: 283 -->

However, the smugglers were pretty hardly hit now and
then. In September, 1773, for instance, French silks and
lace to the value of £15,000 were seized by the revenue
people and the Dragoons in a house at Hawkinge, near
Folkestone, probably the famous Hockley Hole Farm,
known as "Smugglers' Hall." In the same year the
officers met a party of smugglers with thirty horses laden
with tea and lace near Dartford. There was a fight, but
the stuff was captured. But the severest blow was dealt
by Mr. Pitt himself in 1784.


It was December, and the weather had been too coarse
even for Deal smugglers, and most of their boats were
drawn up high and dry on the beach. Pitt was told that
this would be a splendid opportunity for destroying them.
Pitt at once applied to the AVar Office for a regiment of
soldiers, for he knew with what desperate characters he
had to deal. Mr. Clark Russell shall tell the rest of the
story :


\"On the arrival of the regiment at Deal the officer in
command discovered that, although the people had no exact
knowledge of the object of the presence of the soldiers,
there was everywhere current an ugly suspicion that
something injurious to the interests of the place was menaced.
Every publican had pulled down his sign that the soldiers
might have no quarters. The hunt after accommodation
proved of no avail. There was a large barn hard by the
town, large enough to accommodate the troops, and the
quarter-master rode off to talk to the landlord about it,
but the man refused to let it on any other terms than for
two years certain. The commanding officer accepted the
proposal and marched his men in, but he was put to
his wit's ends to obtain provisions for the soldiers.


"Next morning a naval officer named Bray was ordered to
station a few cutters off the beach, and when this was done
the troops marched down to the water's edge. The notion
amongst the people of Deal was that the cutters were there
to receive the soldiers, and that the place would be cleared
of the troops very shortly. A considerable crowd gathered
<!-- Leaf 344, Page: 284 -->
to view the proceedings. Meanwhile the soldiers, with
loaded muskets in their grasp, were so ranged as to cover
the row of luggers. An order was then given, and in a
very short while every smuggling craft along the beach
was in a blaze. The people could only look on, pale with
wrath, but helpless."


In 1794 AA'ilberforce brought before the House of
Commons his proposal for the Abolition of the Slave
Trade. He was encouraged to do this " after a
conversation with Mr. Pitt in the open air at the foot of an old
tree at Holwood, just above the steep descent into the Vale
of Keston:" so may be read in the back of the stone seat
close to the old tree, which is still standing—a wonder,
considering that, not being protected in any way until within
the past few years, it was rapidly being destroyed by
visitors.


The chief event of the year 1797 so far as our county is
concerned was the Mutiny of the Fleet at the Nore. It
was an unfortunate and humiliating proceeding from
beginning to end, inasmuch as it was irrational, ill planned,
ill carried out, and might have caused a national
catastrophe.


It was preceded by a mutiny at Spithead on April 15th
—a mutiny to which Jack had been goaded after long
years of patient suffering, and which, however
reprehensible as a means to right, must claim the sympathy of
every fair-thinking man. The causes of complaint were
the smallness of pay and of the Greenwich pensions, which
had not been augmented since the time of Charles II.; the
unequal distribution of prize money, and last, but by no
means least, the tyrannical power exercised by too many
captains.


The ships' companies appointed two delegates each,
petitions were drawn up in moderate language and
presented, with the result that the men's demands were
complied with and the King's pardon granted. Further
concessions were made later on, and apparently the cloud had
passed away. But on May 20th a mutiny broke out on
<!-- Leaf 345, Page: 285 -->
the ships at the Nore. Two delegates were chosen from
each of the twenty ships and Richard Parker, a " sea
lawyer," one of those men of superior education and glib
speech who are at the bottom of most popular discontents
ashore and afloat, was chosen president, besides a
committee of twelve on each ship. A statement of supposed
grievances in eight articles was drawn up, couched in
peremptory language, and presented to the Admiralty. The
very first article sufficiently showed upon what imperfect
ground the mutineers had taken their stand, for it
demanded that every indulgence which had been granted
to the fleet at Portsmouth should be granted elsewhere.


The authorities refused to comply, upon the very just
grounds that sufficient concessions had already been
made, and that what applied to the fleet at Portsmouth
necessarily applied to the entire Royal Navy.


This exasperated the mutineers; the red flag was run
up, and the ships at Sheerness ordered to drop down to the
Nore. A committee from the Admiralty came to
Sheerness, but all conciliatory efforts failed, and it withdrew,
convinced that there was no course open now but force
The mutineers drew their ships across the river and
stopped all merchant vessels passing up and down, in reply
to which the authorities took up the buoys at the mouth
of the river, constructed batteries on the shore which were
garrisoned by the Gravesend Volunteer Artillery, the
Northfleet Volunteers, the Cobham and the AVest Kent
Yeomanry Cavalry, besides regulars, and cut off all
intercourse between the ships and the shore. Then the
mutineers began to waver, especially when they found that
their comrades at Plymouth and Portsmouth disapproved
of their proceedings. Strange to relate, on June 4th, the
King's birthday, the whole fleet showed its loyalty by
firing a royal salute and by dressing ship, and by keeping
the red flag flying only on the Sandwich. Then some of
the ships slipped away, and by June 13th the Red flag had
disappeared. The Sandwich ran under the guns at
Sheerness, and a party of soldiers sent off to arrest Parker was
allowed to do so.
<!-- Leaf 346, Page: 286 -->

Parker was tried, condemned and executed, as were two
or three other ringleaders, a few men were flogged through
the fleet or imprisoned and the rest pardoned.


About these mutinies Nelson said : " I am entirely with
the seamen in their first complaint. AVe are a neglected
set, and when peace comes are sharply treated, but as for
the Nore scoundrels, I should be happy to command a ship
against them."


On the eve of the great Irish rebellion of 1798, Kent
came in for a prominent share in the public excitement.
Arthur O'Connor, who had been long " wanted " in
connection with the Brotherhood of United Irishmen, and
who was suspected of being in correspondence with the
French General Hoche concerning the invasion of Ireland,
was arrested at Margate, together with a priest O'Coigly
and three others, on the point of embarking for France.
On O'Coigly was found a seditious address from the Secret
Committee of England to the French Executive Directory,
so all were arrested, taken to Maidstone and committed
for trial.


Enormous interest was taken in the case. Fox,
Sheridan, Erskine, AVhitbread, and the Duke of Norfolk
attended as witnesses on behalf of O'Connor, whose
defence was' that he was flying the country simply for his
own good. The result of the trial was that O'Coigly was
found guilty and sentenced to death, O'Connor and the
others were acquitted.


Then ensued a remarkable scene in Court. O'Connor,
upon hearing the verdict in his favour, sprang out of the
dock, and tried to make his w*ay through the Court. A
scrimmage ensued, during which a couple of swords which
lay on the witnesses' table were seized and used.
O'Connor was held by a constable and dragged back to the
bar, and a warrant for his arrest on the charge of high
treason produced. So he was re-arrested, taken to
London, and ultimately banished.


O'Coigly was executed on Penenden Heath. The usual
barbarous accompaniments of executions for high treason
were omitted, and he died professing his innocence.
<!-- Leaf 347, Page: 287 -->

This same year, 1798, renewed alarms of invasion from
France kept our county in constant agitation from end to
end. The most elaborate schemes were drawn up for the
means of offence and defence to be adopted in case of an
emergency, for driving off the live stock from the exposed
parts of the county, for the saving of property, and for
making every available man and woman useful in some
way. Detailed accounts of the stores of grain and
forage, of horses and carts, were collected. Enthusiastic
meetings were held all over the county, at which the
parishioners offered themselves for service en masse.


Every newspaper published subscription lists in aid of
the raising and equipping of forces. The Corporations of
Gravesend and Milton resolved to give up all civic feasting
and entertainment and to apply the funds to the public
cause. Armed associations were formed in every
direction. The Canterbury Volunteers, in reply to a circular
from the Lord Lieutenant asking what dispositions they
could make at an emergency, replied that they were ready
to march anywhere at any time. At a great meeting held
at Sittingbourne on April 18th Lord Romney announced
his intention of forming a corps of rifles and
sharpshooters at his own cost.


Of course, there were ludicrous incidents. A Bromley
volunteer almost blew his front rank man to shreds by
firing off his musket with six charges in it. It was
reported that one Sunday morning, whilst Divine service
was being performed in the Dover churches, sounds of
firing were heard, which produced a panic and emptied
the churches, when it was found that the cause of the
alarm was the firing of a salute. In fairness to Dover,
however, be it said that the report was indignantly denied
in the newspapers.


In 1799 a grand review of Kentish Volunteers was
held at the Mote Park, Maidstone. The King left Kew at
5 a.m., breakfasted with Lord Camden at AVildernesse,
and, as the breakfast was prolonged and the roads were
bad, it was 11.45 before the Royal Party arrived in heavy
<!-- Leaf 348, Page: 288 -->
rain at the Mote. There were present the King, the
Prince of AVales, the Queen, the Dukes of Cumberland and
Gloucester, and the Princesses Augusta and Elizabeth, all
wearing sprigs of oak.


There was a march past, and a sham fight lasting an
hour-and-a-half, and at 3.30 p.m. a banquet, to which 6,000
people sat down. The Court Newsman tells us that the
length of the tables was 7".- miles, the value of the wood
used in their construction £1,500, that Gunter, of Jermyn
Street, was caterer, and that Johnny Townsend, the
famous Bow Street runner, was one of the most active
among the waiters. The proceedings ended with the
singing of " God Save the King " and the drinking of the
King's health by the whole assembly.
<!-- Leaf 349 -->
  
  IX.-LATER KENT.

\ I IHE new century opened with alarms, excursions,
-*■) I 's wars, and rumours of wars. In Kent the first
three years were one long martial fever; men's

minds were occupied with little else than preparations
against invasion, and, as might be expected, in no county
were the preparations more complete.


In 1803 the Secretary of War promulgated his scheme
for the national defence. By this all men capable of
bearing arms between the ages of 17 and 55 were to be
immediately enrolled in four classes : (I) Unmarried men
between 17 and 30; (2) unmarried men between 30 and
50; (3) married men, but with not more than two
children, between 17 and 30; (4) married men between 30
and 55.


The names were to be posted upon all church doors;
each man was to receive two guineas for necessaries, and
one guinea at the expiration of his period of service.
Training was to take place every Sunday, and no man was
to go more than three miles from his home for drill. The
penalty for absence was five shillings, and not even persons
serving in the Militia by substitutes were exempted.


To this national force Kent contributed 1,530 cavalry,
8,800 infantry, and 253 artillery, besides 1,026 men
averaging 5 feet 2 inches in height, to the Army of
Reserve. Nor was this all. A system of Coast Fencibles
had been introduced in 1799 by Captain Popham, by
which the seamen and fishermen were enrolled and trained  
  
  
  u
<!-- Leaf 350, Page: 290 -->
to artillery work in the manning of thirty-six and
fortyoared galleys armed with eighteen pounders or forty-two
pound carronades. They were to be limited in their
operations to their own districts, unless the enemy landed,
when they would follow their commanders.


The system, however, seems to have been badly
arranged, for in 1801 Nelson came down to the Kentish
coast to examine the condition of the Sea Fencibles, who
were exempt from impressment on the condition that they
would come forward for coast defence in case of threatened
invasion. At Margate in August Nelson summoned the
Fencibles on board the defence ships, but out of 2,600 only
385 came forward. " They are no more willing to give up
their occupations than their superiors," remarked Nelson.


This system was elaborated in 1803, and the Kentish
coast divided into districts, thus :  
  
  
  1.—From Dungeness to Sandgate, of which the  
  
  
  rendezvous was New Romney.  
  
  
  2.—From Sandgate to Sandown; rendezvous, Dover.
{empty}3.—From Sandown to the North Foreland;rendezvous, Ramsgate.


This force numbered about 16,000 hardy, resolute,
fearless fellows, who might be depended upon in any
emergency. Only once had they a chance of showing of what
stuff they were made, and this was when a French
privateer attacked two brigs off the North Foreland, and
out went forty or fifty of the Fencible galleys, beat off the
Frenchman and rescued the brigs.


It was about this time that the Deal privateer
Catharine and Mary made for herself such a name. She
only cost about £1,600, and in three months she captured
prizes valued at £60,000. She was at last captured, after
an heroic resistance; her sides almost blown to pieces, her
rigging hanging in shreds, and half her crew dead or
wounded.


Camps were formed at Coxheath, Chatham, Barham
Downs, Ashford, Dover and Shorncliffe. The Military
Canal was cut from Hythe to Rye, ostensibly as an
<!-- Leaf 352 -->
  
  ■ flSHEB. G-AT.

<!-- Leaf 353, Page: 291 -->
obstacle to a commander accustomed to throw men by the
hundred thousand over the broadest and most rapid rivers
of Europe, and as a means of transporting troops and
stores from point to point. The Marfello towers were
built, the idea of them being taken from a tower at
Mortella in Corsica, which in 1794, garrisoned by only
thirty-eight men, made a splendid defence against a
combined sea and land attack by Lord Hood and
MajorGeneral Dundas.


The system of beacons was completed, posts being
established at Canterbury, Shorncliffe, Barham, Thanet,
Shottenden, Hythe, Postling Down, AA'estwell, Pluckley,
Lyndham Hill, Coxheath, whence to Bexley and the
London road, Chatham Lines, AVrotham Hill, Tenterden,
Highgate near Hawkhurst, and Goudhuist, this being the
order of firing according as the first fire was seen from
Canterbury or Goudhurst.


A perfected system of telegraphing by day was
established, by which, under favourable circumstances, a
message could be sent from Deal to London, and a reply
received in seven minutes and a half !


Pitt, as Colonel of the Cinque Ports Volunteers,
reviewed them, 900 strong, at Sandwich. They gave him
nine cheers, and he replied :  
  
  
  " A proud day, indeed ! Now let the enemy come and I  
  
  
  have nothing to fear. I now see I can confide in my

men."


On another occasion he reviewed the Deal Sea
Fencibles. Thirty-five boats, each armed with an eighteen or
a twelve pounder, were paraded and went through
evolutions with that perfect skill and dexterity for which
Deal boatmen are famous, and, although some of the men
on board must have remembered that fatal December
morning nineteen years before on the same beach, they
cheered with the utmost enthusiasm the " pilot who
weathered the storm," especially when he, with a
distinguished company, came afloat from AA'almer Castle for
a nearer inspection, and more especially when he repeated
the visit in the afternoon.

<!-- Leaf 354, Page: 292 -->

All Kent was full of soldiers, who were billeted at
Dover, Ashford, Tunbridge, Sevenoaks, Sittingbourne,Town
Mailing, Wrotham, Wye, Romney, Lydd and Dungeness.


There were big barracks on Brabourne Lees and
at tbe Warren, Ashford. The roads were lively
with marching regiments; the quietest towns were
transformed into centres of bustle and activity; inn
accommodation for the ordinary traveller was hardly
to be had for love or money; children played at
soldiers; old ladies talked soldiers over their twelve
shilling tea; the lasses of Kent had a better time than
they ever had before or ever would have again; the
slouchiest rustic trimmed himself up and squared his
shoulders; and every counter jumper in the county was a
member of some fighting organization or other. And
what a choice of corps he had! There were the
Broadstairs Volunteer Artillery, (Broadstairs must have
diminished wofully since the day when it could run an
Artillery corps of its own !) the Canterbury Rifles, the
Cinque Ports Volunteers, the Deal Volunteer Artillery,
the Deal Volunteer Infantry, the Dover Volunteer
Artillery, the Margate Volunteer Artillery and Infantry,
the Ramsgate Independent Artillery, Arolunteer Artillery
and Volunteer Marksmen, the Ringwould Artillery, the
Maidstone Infantry, Sandwich Artillery, Wingham
Infantry, Ashford Infantry, the Royal Greenwich, the
Holmesdale, the Sheppey Infantry, the Canterbury
Volunteer Dispatch Corps, and a host of others.


On August 2nd, 1803, at a great meeting in Maidstone,
the following address was drawn up and presented to the
King :


\"The humble address of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy,
Freeholders, and others of the County of Kent:


"AVe, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Men of Kent, beg leave at this most important crisis
to approach your Majesty with those sentiments with
which our hearts are animated, and in conformity with
which our hands are prepared to act. AA'e acknowledge
<!-- Leaf 355, Page: 293 -->
with gratitude the goodness of Divine Providence in
having preserved to us our laws, our liberty, and our
constitution under your Majesty's mild and paternal
Government amidst the wreck and destruction of
surrounding nations, and by uniting with Your Majesty
in defence of these inestimable blessings we desire to
prove that we are not unworthy of them. AVe contemplate
with anxiety the formidable attack with which we are
threatened, but without dismay. We are sensible that no
apparent difficulties are sufficient to arrest the progress of
unbounded ambition and unbounded power; and that no
attempt will seem desperate to pride and revenge,
intoxicated by success and irritated by resistance. In a
word, we do not underrate our danger, but resolve to
meet it.


"Placed as we are by nature in the situation most exposed
to the assaults of the foe, and forming, as it were, the
advanced guard of Your Majesty's armed subjects, we
feel that more than common exertions may be expected
from US, and we are prepared to make them; in humble
confidence that if put to the trial, we shall justify our
traditional boast, and prove to our Sovereign and to the
AVorld that Men of Kent will never be conquered."


The same month there was a great review before the
Duke of York at Coxheath of Militia, Yeomanry and
Maidstone Volunteers; inspections at Ashford and in
Chilham Park—Mr. AA'ildman entertaining the troops
royally at the latter place; on Barham Downs the
Canterbury garrison was inspected, and there were field days
at AValmer, Deal and Dover. At Maidstone at a great
patriotic banquet the chorus of " Men of Kent " was sung
with great enthusiasm.


It was at this time that the Prince of AVales offered
his active services, saying, " I ought to be first and
foremost."  
  
  
  To this the King replied :
"Windsor, August 7, 1803.

\"My dear Son,  
  
  
  " Though I applaud your zeal and spirit, of which I trust
<!-- Leaf 356, Page: 294 -->
no one can suppose any of my family wanting, yet,
considering the repeated declarations I have made of my
determinations on your former applications to the same
purpose, I had flattered myself to have heard no farther
on the subject. Should the implacable enemy so far
succeed to land, you will have an opportunity of shewing
your zeal at the head of your regiment. It will be the
duty of every man to stand forth on such an occasion, and
I shall certainly think it mine to set an example in defence
of everything that is dear to me and to my people."


After the Peace of 1815 came twenty years of great
adversity in our country districts. The inflated war
prices did not continue as had been expected, and, as there
had been reckless speculation in land, etc., the great drop
in prices produced forced sales and consequent misery.
The Select Committee of 1833 showed that there was not
one solvent tenant in the AVeald of Kent and Sussex.
The yeomanry were disappearing, and their places were
taken by capitalists—successful merchants and so forth.
In 1793 Boys had said: "The number of yeomanry of
this country seems annually on the increase. There is no
description of persons who can afford to give so much
money for the purchase of an estate as those who buy for
their own occupation. Many estates in the eastern part
of this county have been sold for forty or fifty years
purchase."


Hence only vigorous economy and the non-employment
of labour enabled freeholders to retain lands. However,
the coming of capitalist landlords relieved matters and
somewhat atoned for the disappearance of the yeomanry.


In 1816 the Princess Charlotte, daughter of the Prince
of AVales, was married to Prince Leopold of Coburg, and
a most unpopular match it seems to have been if we may
judge by the reports of public meetings held at this time.


AA'e had been fighting the world so long that we were
getting a little Chauvinistic in our patriotism : moreover,
the foreign connections of our Royal families had not
brought much honour and glory to the country, and so it
<!-- Leaf 357, Page: 295 -->
was that the cry rang out at any rate at the Kentish
meetings : " No more foreigners ! AVe can't afford to keep
'em. No more Hanover rats ! "


In 1820 the unhappy Queen Caroline arrived at Dover
to assert the rights she considered the King had
wrongfully deprived her.


She was enthusiastically received, for the people
unanimously regarded her as a martyr. So great was
the crowd that she was obliged to take refuge at the
York Hotel, from the doors of which she had the guard
removed in deference to the wishes of the people. The
crowd took the horses out of her carriage and dragged it
out of Dover : she was lighted into Canterbury by 100
men with torches, and amidst an enormous crowd drove to
the Fountain. Her journey from Canterbury was one
triumphal progress. At Sittingbourne the clergy received
her. At Gravesend the people drew her to the town.
From Dartford to Shooters Hill she was escorted by
mounted gentlemen. Blackheath was like a fair, and here
she alighted at the famous old Green Man, and bowed her
acknowledgments to the cheering crowd, dressed in " a
black twilled sarsenet gown, a fur tippet and muff, and a
hat of black satin with feathers."


Smuggling continued to be extensively carried on, and
it was estimated that the annual loss to the Revenue from
smuggling and the cost of the Preventive Service, or the
Coast Blockade as it was now called, was £1,000,000.
\"Guinea " smuggling especially assumed enormous
dimensions during the years of the Peninsular AVar. Guineas
were bought up at twenty-seven shillings a piece, carried
over to Gravelines, Dunkirk, or Calais in ten-oared galleys,
and fetched a high premium. They are said to have been
largely used in payment of the French troops in Spain.
Folkestone, Deal, and Dover were the chief "Guinea"
ports, and the usual punishment of captured smugglers
was service for a term of years in the Royal Navy. Hence
a contemporary bard says :
<!-- Leaf 358, Page: 296 -->
  
  " They dragged us up to Hover gaol,

In iron bound like thieves,
All for to serve great George our King,

And force us to the seas."


Large fortunes were made in our Kentish coast towns
by this traffic, in which highly respectable mercantile
houses were not ashamed of dabbling, and Deal in
particular attained a prosperity it never reached before
or since.


In 1828 the Catholic Emancipation movement was
agitating the country. Although the penalties inflicted by
the severe laws against Roman Catholics in the reigns of
Elizabeth and James I. had long since been repealed the
disabilities remained. Many efforts had been made to
remove these. At the union with Ireland in 1800 Pitt
had promised that this should be done, but George III.
would never consent. Three times the motion in favour of
it had passed through the Commons, and as many times
had been rejected by the Lords. A great county meeting
was held on Penenden Heath, October 24th, 1828, at which
some say were 20,000 people, some say 60,000. The High
Sheriff of Kent presided; on his left were the Earl of
AVinchilsea and the opposition party, clergymen and
dissenters, and a crowd of rough fellows in yellow smocks,
armed with thick sticks, who were not there by accident.
On his right were the Earl of Radnor, Lord Camden,
Lord Darnley and the supporters of the Bill. The petition
was proposed by Gypps and seconded by Plumptre. Violent
speeches were made, and a very long one by a Mr. Shiel.
AYhat the result of the division was nobody knows to this
day, so great was the disorder and so many the
interruptions. The majority was said to be much in favour of
the Bill, but other reports are to the contrary. Eventually
the Duke of Wellington's Ministry passed the Bill by a
majority of 17S in the Commons and 104 in the Lords.


The next great agitation was about Parliamentary
Reform. In 1832 the Bill was finally passed, after having
been repeatedly opposed by the Lords; but before this had
<!-- Leaf 359, Page: 297 -->
been effected the country had gone through a period of
great disorder and popular discontent. There was nothing
in Kent like the terrible riot at Bristol, in which the
bishop's palace, the mansion house, almost the whole of one
of the principal squares, the custom house, the excise
office, and the gaols were destroyed, but in all the chief
towns of the county meetings were held, marked by more
or less disorder, and remembered by many scores of men
who had had their heads broken thereat.


By this measure no less than 54 boroughs were
disenfranchised; many of these thoroughly deserved the epithet
of " rotten," and all were of insufficient importance to
send separate representatives. Only three of this number
have since moved sufficiently with the times to have the
privilege restored—East Grinsted in Sussex, Newton in
Lancashire, and Appleby in AYestmoreland.


As regards the County of Kent, the following changes
were effected by this great Bill. Queenborough and New
Romney, which had hitherto each returned two members,
ceased to return any at all. Hythe, which had hitherto
returned two members, was to return one only.
Greenwich, a new borough, was to return two members;
Chatham, also a new borough, was to return one.
Sandwich, retaining its two members, was to include Deal and
AA*almer; whilst there were to be four Knights of the
Shire in the place of two. The number of members
remained the same, but the distribution was different.


Since 1832 further changes have been made in Kentish
Parliamentary Representation, and for purposes of
comparison I here subjoin tables of the three periods. The
numbers refer to the members.

In the year 1833 the neighbourhood of the City of
Canterbury was mildly excited by the appearance there of
Sir AVilliam Percy Honeywood Courteney, Knight of
Malta, of Hales and Evington in Kent, and Powderham
in Devonshire—or rather, of an individual wearing a
purple cloak, girt with a sword, and attended by two pages
in scarlet livery, who called himself all this. At first he
was regarded merely as an eccentric; but when he got to
haranguing the rustics about their rights and their
wrongs, and finally gave himself out to be Somebody
whom he certainly was not, more than passing attention
was paid to him.


Then he put himself up as a candidate for the
Parliamentary representation of the City of Canterbury, filled the
place with posters and placards, appeared on the hustings
in Oriental dress, challenged Sir Thomas Tylden, Sir
Brook Brydges, Sir Edward Knatchbull and Sir AVilliam
Cosway to mortal combat, as " four cowards unfit to
represent the brave men of Kent," and canvassed with such
success that his rival became anxious.


Suddenly he was indicted for perjury which he had
committed in his over zeal for some Kentish smugglers;
he was tried at Maidstone, July 25th, 1833, under his
real name of Thorn, and sentenced to transportation, but
was found to be insane and was sent to Barming Asylum.
Here he remained four years and then was released. He
<!-- Leaf 361, Page: 299 -->
lived in the house of a Mr. Francis at Fairbrook, near
Boughton, but his wild behaviour, his violent speeches
about the new Poor Law, his exhortations and promises,
made him a nuisance as a tenant, and he changed his
quarters to Bosenden Farm.


Men gathered round him in a blind faith inexplicable in
such an age, and he paraded the villages bearing a white
flag with a blue border and stamped with a rampant lion,
his followers carrying sticks with loaves of bread stuck on
them. All about the Stour valley villages he preached his
doctrine of salvation and regeneration at the expense of
earthly powers, and to this day in cottages at Eastling,
Throwley, Selling, Badlesmere and elsewhere his
portrait may be seen.


He was rapidly becoming a public nuisance, for he led
men away from their work, and at length a matter-of-fact
farmer named Curtis applied for a warrant against him.
Mears, a constable, went to Bosenden Farm early one
morning, thinking to surprise Thom. But Thorn was on
the look out, asked Mears what his business was, and then
shot him dead, and wounded another man of the same
name. "The work goes well," said he, "a second Gideon
has come to slay the ungodly; and thus would perish all
who should oppose the prophet Courteney."


The alarm was now general. Thom, with his followers,
went to Bosenden AVood, the county magistrates resolved
to capture him and sent to Canterbury for soldiers of the
45th Regiment.


This was smartly done. It was 32 miles there and
back, and in 2 A- hours the answer came that the soldiers
were starting.


One hundred soldiers came, Lieutenant Bennett in
command, and were divided into two detachments to
surround the wood, for it was known that the madman and
his followers would make a desperate resistance. AA*ith
the soldiers went the Rev. Dr. Poore, Mr. Knatchbull,
Mr. Halford and Mr. Baldock, justices of the peace.
<!-- Leaf 362, Page: 300 -->

Bennett stepped forward and counselled Thom to
surrender quietly. Thom fired and killed him, but was
himself shot the next minute. Thorn's men rushed on
the soldiers and a desperate fight ensued, which lasted,
so it is said, from mid-day until seven at night. The
result was that seven of Thorn's men were killed and nine
w*ounded, whilst the soldiers had their officer and one man
killed and six wounded.  
  
  
  Such was the Battle of Bosenden, as it is called.


At the Maidstone Assizes of May 31st, 1838, Price and
Mears were sentenced to death, but this was commuted to
transportation for life; six others were sentenced to one
year's imprisonment, of which one month was to be solitary
confinement.


Surely no more bitter lesson was ever read to employers
of labour upon the evil of neglecting the welfare of their
subordinates than this of these poor misguided clowns
risking their lives for the sake of a madman, almost within
sight of the Cathedral of Canterbury !


\"Sir William " was a Cornishman named John Nicholas
Thom : his portrait is still to be seen on the walls of inns
and cottages in the neighbourhood, and the name of " Mad
Thorn's Corner " still keeps alive the memory of what has
been fairly termed " The last English Battle," for, small as
is the list of casualties, it is longer than the killed and
wounded roll of many a conflict between great captains in
the days of heavy armour.


The list of famous Kent men during the periods
embraced by these two last chapters is a goodly one.


Of Chatham and Pitt we have already spoken. The
courtly Lord Chesterfield was a Kent man, so was General
AA*olfe of AVesterham, and Sir Sidney Smith the gallant
defender of St. Jean d'Acre against Bonaparte in 1799,
was, if not Kent born, educated at Tunbridge School. The
unfortunate Admiral Byng, and Sir George Rooke, who
captured Gibraltar in 1704, belonged to our county.
George Grote, the historian of Greece, was a Kent man;
the families of Gibbon the historian and Cowper the poet
<!-- Leaf 363, Page: 301 -->
were connected with Kent. Horace AValpole was the
youngest son of Sir Robert AValpole, who married the
daughter of John Shorter of Bybrook in Kennington. The
Rev. John Barham, author of the Ln-jolelsby Legends, was
Kentish, and if Charles Dickens was not Kentish by birth
he was by latter residence, and the county is intimately
associated with some of his most popular books and stories
—curiously with Pickwick and Edwin Drooel, his first and
last books.


Lord Tennyson is associated with Kent inasmuch as his
family moved to Boxley from Tunbridge Wells, whither
they had gone from Lincolnshire, and the Park of Park
House, Boxley, the seat of his friends the Lushingtons, is
described in the Prologue to the Princess.  
  
  
  NOTE ON LATER KENT.


The disgraceful condition of the representation of the country
maybe exemplified by a table taken from the New Annual Register
of 1813; at this time Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester were
unrepresented, whilst places with twenty, and even a less number
ol inhabitants, returned members :—

  APPENDIX.  
  
  
  A.—ROYAL KENT.


In additional support of my contention that Kent has the best
right of all Counties to the epithet Royal I subjoin a few facts
in connection with some of our Kentish places. If any other
Countj*, of course excepting Middlesex, can establish a claim to
closer and more constant association with the Royalty of England,
Appendix A shall disappear from any future edition of this work.  
  
  
  1.—Canterbury.


After Hengist destroyed Canterbury in a.d. 460, the City lay
desolate and deserted until Ethelbert re-built and re-occupied it,
and throughout the duration of the Kingdom of Kent the Kings
of Kent had their palace here and were buried here.

In 597 Christianity came to Canterbur}*, and from Canterbury was
spread throughout Britain.

In 10*23 Canute presented his golden crown to the Cathedral.

In 1130 Henry I. kept his Court here with David, King of
Scotland, and all the bishops.

In 1174 Henry II. performed penance here for the murder of
Becket, and came regularly for some years.

In 1179 Louis VII. of France came.


In 1189 Richard I. received the homage of William, King of
Scotland, and came here in 1194 on his return from the Crusades.


In 1201 John and Isabella of France were crowned here, and in
12114 he kept the festival of Christmas here.


In 1220 Henry III. was here on the occasion of the translation of
Becket's remains, was re-crowned here in 12.36, married Eleanor of
Provence here, and kept the Christmas of 1263 here.


In 1299 Edward I. was married here toMargaret of France, on
which occasion he presented the Cathedral with the Royal Crown
of Scotland, and in 1300 paid " chevage"—£2—for a child to be
born.


In 1357 the Black Prince came here after Poictiers with his
prisoner John of France; in 1363 he married here Joan, the Fair
Maid of Kent, and he was buried here.

In 1400 Emmanuel, Emperor of the East, came. Henry IA*. and
his Queen, Joan of Navarre, were buried here.

In 1415 Henry V. came here after Agincomt.

In 1417 Sigismund, Emperor of the West, was here.

In 1465 Edward IV. and Elizabeth Woodville were here, and
presented the North Window of the Martyrdom. Henry of
Richmond, afterwards Henry VIL, married Elizabeth of York here,
and as King often kept his Court at Canterbury.

In 1520 Heni'3* VIII. came here, and with Charles V. of Spain
was magnificently entertained. Anne of Cleves lodged in
Canterbury on her way to meet Henry.
<!-- Leaf 365, Page: 303 -->

Philip of Spain was here in 1555 and Mary in 1558.

Elizabeth kept her Court here in 1573, and lodged here on the
occasion of her accompanying her suitor, the Duke of Anjou, to the
Coast.  
  
  
  Charles I. married Henrietta Maria here.


Charles II. stayed three nights here on his way to London at his
Restoration.


William and Mary were here in 1689.

George I. was here in 1720; George II. in 1728; the Prince
Regent in 1798.

The Prince Consort was here in 1S40, and Her present Gracious
Majesty in 1835 and 1842.  
  
  
  2.—Eltham.


Possibly the Anglo-Saxon Kings of Kent had a palace here.

In 1270 Henry III. kept Christmas here. 'Phis is the first
record we have of Eltham after the building of it by Bee, the
fighting Bishop of Durham, who presented it to Edward II., and
who died here.


In 1308 Edward II. and his bride, Isabella of France, came
here from Dover, aud in 1316 his son, known as John of Eltham,
was born here.


Edward III. held Parliaments here in 1329, in 1331—when were
passed the Statutes of Eltham for the regulation of the Royal
Household—and in 1375.


In 1347 Lionel, third son of Edward III., kept Christmas here
during the absence of his father in France.

In 1356 John of France brought here as prisoner and was royally
entertained, and 1365 he returned here voluntarily after his
liberation by the Peace of Bretigny.

Richard II. lived much here, and in 13S6 received here Leo
of Armenia, who had been driven from his kingdom by the
Turks.


Henry IV. kept the Christmas feasts of 1405, 1409 and 1412 here,
and often lived here.


Henry V. kept the Christmas of 1414 here; Henry A*I. was
often here and kept the Christmas of 1428 here.

Edward IV. added and beautified much; he probably built the
existing parts, the hall and the bridge; his fourth daughter,
Bridget, was born here in 1480.

In 1482 he gave a magnificent Christinas entertainment here to
two thousand guests.

Henry VII. preferred Greenwich to Eltham, but his children
were brought up here, and he added a stately front to the
Palace.


Henry VIII. also preferred Greenwich, but he kept the Christmas
feasts of 1515 and 1526 here.


Elizabeth was frequently here as a child, but she also preferred
Greenwich.


In 1612 James I. visited Eltham, hunting here with his
fatherin-law, Christian of Denmark, and he was the last sovereign here.

Eltham was occupied by the Earl of Essex during the Civil War,
and he died here in 1646. Parliament spoiled Eltham, after the
Kentish Rising of 1648, the deer were killed, the gardens and
pleasure grounds wasted, and the Palace neglected. In 1650 it was
<!-- Leaf 366, Page: 304 -->
sold to Major Rich, but it never recovered, although it reverted to
the Crown at the Restoration. Trees were felled, the buildings
knocked about, and the magnificent hall was only preserved because
it made a good barn. It was valued at £2,754, and was described
as having "one fair chapel, one great hall, 36 rooms and offices
below stairs, witli two large cellars; above stairs 17 lodging rooms
on the King's side, 12 on the Queen's and nine on the Prince's; 78
rooms in the offices round the courtyard, which occupied one acre."
The Palace was reported to be much out of repair and
untenantable.  
  
  
  3.—Greenwich.


Edward I. probably had a palace at Greenwich. Henry IA*. in
1408 dated his will from his Manor of Greenwich, which seems to
have been his favourite residence. In 1433 the King gave Duke
Humphrey of Gloucester a grant of 200 acres for a park, and in 1437
leave was given him to build there a fortified mansion, and this he
called Placentia.


Edward IA*. enlarged and adorned much at Greenwich, and gave
it to his Queen, Elizabeth Woodville. In 1482 the Lady Mary,
Edward's daughter, died here.

Henry VII. acquired the estate by his arbitrary imprisonment
of Elizabeth Woodville; he much enlarged the Paiace, frequently
kept his Court here, kept the Christmas feast of 1492 here, and
founded the adjoining Grey Friars' Convent. Henry VIII. was
born here and baptised in tlie parish church. He kept Christmas,
1512, here "with great and plentiful cheer," and tlie same feast
next year " with great solemnity, dancing, disguisings, mummeries,
in a most princely manner." At the Christmas of 1515 was held the
first masquerade in England.

At Greenwich the King married Katheriue of Arragon, Anne
Boleyn and Anne of Cleves, and his youngest sister, Princess Mary
Tudor, was married to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, in
Greenwich.


In 1527 a magnificent entertainment was given here in honour of
the French ambassadors, who were eight persons of high quality,
attended by 600 horse, in a sort of competition with that which
Wolsey had just given at Hampton Court to the same grandees, but
the King's excelled the minister's as much as gold excels silver, said
old Stow.


Henry VIII. embellished and added to Greenwich so much that
it inspired Leland to celebrate the work in Latin verse, of wllich
Hasted gives the following translation :—  
  
  
  ' How bright the lofty seat appears,
Like Jove's great palace, pav'd with stars !
What roofs ! what windows charm the eye,
What turrets, rivals of the sky ! "


Elizabeth loved Greenwich, and kept her Court and all the great
festivals, especially that of St. George, of whieh we modern
Englishmen know and cave so little, with great pomp. She entertained
the Lady Ambassadress from France here, and bade farewell to all
her naval heroes from here. It was ofl' Greenwich that she was
very nearly accidentally shot by a young man, Thomas Appletree
by name, who fired a gun at random. " The bullet came so nere
<!-- Leaf 367, Page: 305 -->
Her Grace, within sixe foote at least." Appletree was, in the
rough and ready manner of the time, condemned to death for his
mishap, but Elizabeth pardoned him. It was at Greenwich,
according to some authorities, at Deptford according to others, that
took place the episode of Raleigh, tlie cloak and the puddle.

Edward VI. was born and died at Greenwich.  
  
  
  Mary was born here.
James I., who settled Greenwich on his wife, Anne of Denmark,

was very fond of the palace and park.

Charles I. lived here much before the outbreak of the Civil War,

and it was from Greenwich that he went to set up the standard of
war at Nottingham in 1642. After his execution Greenwich passed
out of royal hands, and was condemned to be sold. In 1652 it was
given to Whitlocke, and in 1654 was appointed to be the Protector's
residence. Under the Parliament the palace was much neglected
and fell into such a ruinous condition that when at the Restoration
it became once more royal property, Charles II. pulled it down and
commenced building a new Placentia in magnificent style—so
magnificent indeed that he could only afford to finish one wing,
the Western, whieh still exists.

Mary, wife of William of Orange, was received at Greenwich. It
was her idea to turn Charles' Wing into a Naval Hospital, but she
did not live either to endow the work or to see it more than
commenced; in the meanwhile Charles' Wing was kept as a reception
house for foreigners of distinction.

Generally treating of the connection of royalty with the county,
it may be said that if one road in all England is more Royal than
any other it is that between Dover and London, along which every
one of our Kings and Queens must have constantly passed, as well
as every foreign sovereign or person of distinction who visited our
land up to the era of railways. Sandwich and Margate were
favourite ports of embarcation for our early sovereigns : the Royal
list of Dover must be the longest in the world; whilst all the places
on the London road—Canterbury, Sittingbourne, Rochester,
Blackheath, have their associations with Royalty.  
  
  
  B.—THE CINQUE PORTS.


"Of what antiquity these ports and ancient towns are," says
Jeake, "When enfranchised, or at what time their members were
annexed lo them, are things so dark and difficult to be discovered
that without great labour and search (if then) little certainty can
be had."

So we will at once proceed to what is known about them.
Although the name was used soon after the Norman Conquest it
first appears regularly in the reign of John.

The original Cinque Ports were : in order of precedency :—
Hastings, Sandwich, Dover, Romney, and Hythe.

To these are attached the two Ancient Towns of Eye and
Winchelsea.

The following is a complete table of the Cinque roits and their
\"Limbs":
'Corporate Members : Pevensey and Season!.
Non-corporate : Bulverhithe, Petit Iham (on the

•Even in 1803 Brightlingsea was reminded by the election of a
deputy at Sandwich that it was still a Limb of Sandwich. This
connection has existed since the reign of Henry VII.; it paj-ing £.5
and an annual 10s. towards the Cinque Ports Navy.
/Corporate Member : Lydd.

The '' Ancient Town " of Rye had a corporate Limb in Tenteiden.

The complete table of precedency is :

1, Hastings. 2, Sandwich. 3, Dover. 4, Romney. 5, Hythe.
6, Rye. 7, Winchelsea. 8, Seaford. 9, Pevensey. 10, Fordwich.
11, Folkestone. 12, Faversham. 13, Lydd. 14, Tenterden.

The services rendered by the Cinque Ports in return for the
privileges they enjoyed, apart from the fact that for a long time their
fleet constituted the Royal Navy of England, were to furnish
57 ships at their own charge every year for 15 days at the summons
of the King. Each ship had 20 armed soldiers in addition to its
crew, and the full complement was: 57 ships, 1,187 men, and 57
\"garcions," or "gromets," or boys.

Hastings owed its recognised position as head of the Cinque
Ports, perhaps either because it happened to be first named in the
charters of William I. and his successors, or from a kindly feeling
which he naturally held towards the port nearest the scene of the
victory which gave him the dominion of England. Jeake is of
opinion that Hastings really always was the most powerful,
wealthy and influential port; an opinion supported by an
examination of the proportionate contributions of Hastings to the navy
in early times. Thus, in the very interesting connection between
the Cinque Ports and Yarmouth, whereto, during the great herring
fair, which lasted from Michaelmas to Martinmas, the Ports sent
their Bailiffs to represent them and were empowered to share
the local Government for the time being, and allowed licence to
land cargoes on the Strand, and dry nets on the Den, we find
that Hastings sent two Bailiffs, whereas the other ports 011I3- sent
one, and paid a double allowance to them.

These annual Yarmouth meetings were often occasions of violent
strife between the Ports and the town. In 1207 apitched battle took
place at sea in which 37 Yarmouth vessels were taken or dcstroved
to the value of £15,000, and 171 men were killed. In 1303
Yarmouth complained that from these quarrels it had lost £20,000.
So late as 1575 there was a squabble about prenomination in
proclamations and the style of the Court which was temporarily settled
the next year bj- an arrangement that the prenomination should be
by alternate years. It was once proposed that Yarmouth should
<!-- Leaf 371, Page: 307 -->
be made a Cinque Port, but nothing came of it. Gradually
Yarmouth discontinued the already reduced payment of £3 per annum
to the Ports, and the Ports only sent two Bailiffs—one for the
Eastern and one for the Western Ports.


The annual Yarmouth meeting was a grand combination of
holiday and business. On the clay before Michaelmas Day the
Bailiffs came to Yarmouth accompanied by counsel, town clerk,
two sergeants with white rods, one French horn man, one standard
bearer and one gaoler. Feasting and entertainment tilled up the
intervals between business : The Cinque Ports Bailiffs kept open
house, bringing with them eighteen hogsheads of good ale to help
matters out, Yarmouth's Corporation reciprocated, and when there
was no squabbling no doubt the three weeks passed all too quickly.

The privileges enjoyed by thc Cinque Ports, it is said, from the
days of Edward the Confessor, and since confirmed by different
sovereigns from William I. to Charles II., were various. They
were only taxed one-third of the amount levied upon inland
towns. Even in Saxon times the freemen of the Cinque Ports
ranked as nobles, for the burgesses they sent to Parliament were
called Barons; their summons and their oath of fidelity to the
Crown was that they would maintain and defend to their utmost
power the liberties, franchises, privileges and customs of the
Cinque Ports and their members. Before the division of
Parliament into two houses the names of the Peers of the Realm and
of the Cinque Ports Barons were called separately from those of
the knights, burgesses and citizens, and they probably ranked after
the higher clergy and nobility, and before the lower clergy and
other representatives. They sent 14 members to Parliament; to-day
onlj* Hastings, Dover, and Hythe with Folkestone are
represented. The Cinque Ports were independent of the Shire, the Lath
and the Hundred.


In the (Ireat Charter the piivilegesof the Cinque Ports and those
of London are alone exclusively mentioned.

They claimed and maintained the right of supporting the
canopies of the sovereigns at their coronation, the first occasion
being the coronation of Henry III. and Eleanor of Provence, and
only once has this custom been broken—at the coronation of
James I., when the canopy was borne by eight gentlemen of the
Privy Chamber.

The canopy is of purple silk, with four silvered staves, and on
each staff a silver and gilt bell. Four Barons supported each
stave. In the case of a double coronation the Barons of Hastings
held one canopy, and after the ceremony presented it to the shrine
of Saint Richard at Chiehester; the Barons of the other Ports held
the second canopy and presented it to Saint Thomas Shrine at
Canterbury, dividing the staves and bells among themselves.

The pulpit cloth of St. Clement's church, Hastings, is said to
have been made out of the coronation canopy of George I.

An extraordinary coincidence in connection with this privilege
occurred in 1820, when the late Lord Brougham, who as Henry
Brougham, the Attorney-General of Queen Caroline, had arrainged
King George IV. at the bar of public opinion, was, as member for
Wiiichelsea, one of the Cinque Ports Barons to hold the canopy over
the King at his coronation.  
  
  
  v 2
<!-- Leaf 372, Page: 308 -->

The Barons of the Cinque Ports also enjoyed the privilege of
sitting at the coronation banquet at the uppermost table on the
King's right hand.

At the coronation of George III. the Cinque Ports Barons
complained to Lord Talbot, the Lord Steward, that no table had been
set apart for them. Said he : " If you come to me as Lord Steward
I tell you it is impossible; if as Lord Talbot I am a match for any
of you." (Walpole's Letters).

The Cinque Ports were also free from all taxes and subsidies for
the regular army.

Theie were of course many other privileges peculiar to different
Ports. Thus, in the case of Romney, the law of the land that
all waste lands belong to the Crown did not apply, for it was
maintained that the Crown held no waste lands in Romney Marsh, and
the first settlers might deal with any unappropriated land as they
thought fit. This is still the usage of the Marsh.

Three kinds of meetings were held by the Ports—Brotherhoods,
Brotherhood and Guestlings, and Guestlings.

At a Brotherhood, or a Brotherhood and Guestling, all Ports
and Members had to be represented. A Guestling might be
summoned bj* any of the Ports for business of their own, or what
concerned only another Port.

The meetings were General or Special. The General Meeting
was held twice a year—on the Tuesday after Easter, and on the
Tuesday after St. Margaret's Day. Special Meetings were held
for special occasions, and as circumstances might demand. The
original meetings were held at Shepway or Shipway Cross, an
open space at the junction of four roads on the top of the hills
between Westenhanger and Lympne. They were first ordered
to be held here by Henry III. Here the Lord Warden, whose
office has been traced to that of the Ancient Count of the
Saxon Shore, was elected, and here were heard cases of treason,
falsifying money, services withdrawn, false judgment, and the
finding of treasure.

After the Revolution of 168S the Court of Shepway was
transferred to Bredenstone Hill on the south-west of Dover. The
modern Courts are held at a central Port.


At the General Guestlings the head officer of one of the Ports
or of the Ancient Town presides, and is addressed as "Mr.
Speaker." On each side of him are the other mayors and
bailiffs, then the bailiff to Yarmouth, and below them the jurats,
who were assistants to the Head Officer, aud of whom each Port
had twelve.


The Speakership is an annual office, and moves in rotation
from Hastings. If any other town than Hastings be Speaker,
Hastings always sits on the Speaker's right hand, and if Sandwich
be not Speaker, Sandwich sits on his left.

The circular sent by the Speaker Town runs as follows :

\"Right Worshipful Sirs : loving brethren, combarons and
friends : Our right hearty affections and salutations to you
presented. Whereas by Septennary Revolution (the five Ports
and the two Ancient Towns) the Speakership of the Ports is now
devolved upon us, we have thought meet to issue forth these our
timely letters to you, whereby we pray and brotherly require
your advice and subscriptions, whether, as our affairs now stand,
<!-- Leaf 373, Page: 309 -->
a Brotherhood and Guestling, or either of them is necessary to be
arreared this year. We for our parts considering (here the
business to be transacted is detailed), are of opinion and think fit,
that both a Brotherhood and a Guestling be summoned to meet at
the town and port of, in the County of Kent, on the
Tuesday after the Feast of St. Margaret next ensuing at the hour
accustomed."


The independence of the Cinque Ports of old is exemplified in
the peculiarities of their local customs and laws. Thus capital
punishment varied at different Ports. At Dover criminals were
thrown over Shakespeare's Cliff. At Sandwich they were buried
alive on what was called Thief's Down. At Fordwich they were
drowned in Thief's Well—a name still memorialised in Thew's
Lane.


Scolding women were fastened by an iron collar to a post in the
market place for an hour; larceny was punished by the loss of an
ear, or by a whipping, or hy having a billet nailed to the ear.
Immorality was punished by banishment from the town.

Sanctuary was strictly observed. The felon fled to a
churchyard, and, confessing his felony, his goods and chattels were
forfeited, he remained in sanctuary forty days, then was given a
cross as a passport, and sent off to an assigned port, only to tarry
an ebb and a flood before leaving the country.

It is notable that the Mayors of Sandwich and Fordwich carried
black rods instead of white like the others; perhaps this was for
some ancient mayoral delinquency.

The decadence of the Cinque Ports is observable in the middle of
the sixteenth century. Even Dover in 1565 is lamented over as
containing but 358 inhabited houses, and owning but 20 ships.
Towards the national fleet in the Armada year the Cinque Ports
contributed but five ships and "one handsome pinnace." Evelyn
thus describes Winchelsea in 1652 :


\"I walk'd over to survey the mines of Winchelsea, that ancient
Cinque Port which, by the remaines and mines of ancient streetes
and public structures, discovers it to have been formerly a
considerable and large citty. There are to be seen vast caves and
vaults, walls and towers, mines of monasteries, and of a
sumptuous church, in which are handsome monuments, especially
of the Templars, buried just in the manner of those in the Temple
in London. This place being now all rubbish, and a few despicable
hovells and cottages now standing, hath yet a mayor."

It is hardly necessary to say that the special privileges of the
Cinque Ports have been much abridged, especially by the
Municipal Corporations Reform Act, but the jurisdiction of the Lord
Warden as Admiral of the Coast has not been touched, and this
jurisdiction embraces many subjects usually confined to the
Municipality. The ancient " Court of Lode Manage," at which pilots
were licensed and complaints heard of misconduct or inefficiency,
was only abolished in 1853, when the Trinity House took over its
duties.


Fordwich (Limb of Sandwich), Seaford and Pevensey (Limbs of
Hastings) were abolished by the Act of 1883.

By the courtesy of Mr. Stringer, one of the Solicitors to the
Ports, I am enabled to give the address presented to Her Majesty
on the occasion of Her Diamond Jubilee by the Ports as drawn up
<!-- Leaf 374, Page: 310 -->
at a Court of Brotherhood and Guestling, held in the Town Hall,
Dover, June 26th, 1897. Dover (speaker), Hastings, Sandwich,
Romney, Rye, Deal, Ramsgate, Faversham, Folkestone, Margate,
Lydd, and Tenterden sent Mayors or representatives, the former
appearing in full costume, with chains, maces, and insignia; and,
after the summons, couched exactly in the language before quoted,
was read out, the address was agreed to :

\"May it please Your Majesty,—We, the barons aud combarons,
and other representatives of the Cinque Ports, two Antient Towns,
aid their members, assembled in Courts of Brotherhood and
Guestling, especially convened for this purpose, and in accordance
with ancient usage, humbly desire to assure your Majesty of our
constant unabated lo3*alty and attachment to your Majesty's sacred
person, to every member of the Royal Family, and to the Throne
and Institutions of the United Kingdom, and to sincerely offer
our heartfelt congratulation on the auspicious occasion of your
Majesty having completed a reign of 60 years over a loyal and
prosperous people, an event unparalleled in the history of our
country.


\"We deem it fitting to remind 3*our Majest)* that we are, in all
probability, the most ancient recognised Corporate Body still in
existence within your Realm. In olden times the noble deeds of
our ancestors in providing and maintaining, at their own costs and
charges, for your Majesty's predecessors, Kings and Queens of
England, goodly fleets for the protection of our shores, were from
time fully recognised and appreciated by Royal grants of various
privileges and liberties, some of which are still existing 

"Given at our Courts of Brotherhood and Guestling aforesaid,

  C—TRAVELLING IN KENT.


From all accounts our county seems to have been hard and
dangerous travelling ground up to a comparatively recent date, and
it is much to be questioned if our Kentish Watling Street was at
the end of the last century in half as good a condition as it
was when the last Roman legionaries tramped along it
fourteenand-a-half centuries ago. As for cross-country journejs, even
when performed by Kings and Archbishops, they must have been
sore trials of patience and endurance, and we need not be surprised
that the great men found it necessary to have magnificent rest
houses at short intervals, and that they carried their households
with them.


Tn the reign of Henry VIII. the roads of the Weald were so bad
that in the year 1523 was passed the first known Act of Parliament
for the repair and regulation of thoroughfares : and we know that
Good Queen Bess, in 1573, found in the Wild of Kent "More
dangerous rocks and valleys and much worse ground than in the
Peak."
<!-- Leaf 375, Page: 311 -->

In Charles II. 's time, Soubierre, the French Ambassador,
preferred to travel in a waggon drawn by six horses in line to
risking himself in a regular conveyance. Evelyn was obliged to
have six horses to drag his carriage when he paid his visit to Scott's
Hall in the same reign, during which the journey from Rye to
London took two long days, and the coach from London to the
Sussex coast could proceed no further than Tunbridge. In 1686
Mr. Jeake, of Rye, occupied five hoius-and-a-half in performing the
twenty-three miles between Rye and Lamberhurst; then he lost
his way, and wound up by taking ten hours by stage coach in
doing the thirty miles between Tunbridge and London.

Nor were matters much better a century later, for Hasted
writing, not of by-ways, but of turnpike roads, says :

\"The roads of these parts are hardly passable after any rain,
being so miry that the traveller's horse frequently plunges through
them up to the girths of the saddle, and the waggons sink so deep
in the ruts as to slide along on the nave of the wheels and the axle
of them."


In 1752 Horace AValpole travelling in Kent writes of
Tunbridge :

\"Now begins our chapter of woes. The inn was full of farmers
and tobacco; and, the next morning, when we were bound for
Penshurst, the only man in the town who had two horses would not
let us have them because the roads, as he said, were so bad."

He got to Lamberhurst, and says :

"Here our woes increase. The roads grew bad beyond all
badness, the night dark beyond all darkness, our guide frightened
be3*ond all frightfulness. However, without being at all killed, we
got up, or down, I forget whieh, it was so dark, a famous precipice
called Silver Hill, and about 10 at night arrived at a wretched
village called Robertsbridge. We had still six miles hither, but
determined to stop, as it would be a pity to break all our necks
before we had seen all we intended. But alas ! there was only one
bed to be had; all the rest were inhabited by smugglers, whom
the people of the house called mountebanks... Armed with
links and lanthorns we set out again, and at two o'clock in
the morning we got hither to a still worse inn, and that crammed
with excise officers, one of whom had just shot a smuggler."

\"Pray, whenever you travel in Kentish roads," he writes later
on, " take care of keeping your driver sober."

From Sissinghurst Walpole went to " Bocton-Malherbe," "but
the roads were so exceedingly bad that it was dark before we got
thither... I hope you will be as weary with reading our

history as we have been in travelling it."

But bad roads were not the worst annoyances with which the
traveller had to put up with. The great lines of communication
swarmed with robbers and rascals of all sorts, from the gentleman
with a crape mask who stopped passengers and eased them of
their purses, to the rascally inn-keeper who charged them
extortionately for the vilest of accommodation. "So are most thieves
in Christendome and Kent "wrote Taylor the poet, and "a fine
country inhabited by a lot of villains " is the translation of Lord
Says' reply to Dick thc Butcher, who asked him what he thought
of Kent.
<!-- Leaf 376, Page: 312 -->

The great roads were infested with highwaymen, especially the
Dover Road on Blackheath, at Shooters Hill, at Bexley Heath,
Gadd's Hill and across Barham Downs, and the lines of gibbets
bearing the bodies of the cowardly rascals whom so many writers
exalt as romantic heroes were such familiar objects as hardly to be
noticed by the traveller.

The records of the road during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries are full of attacks and murders, and a large proportion
of the criminals who provided public entertainment for the
multitude on Tyburn Mondays suffered "for the highway."

In 1652 Evelyn was waylaid at Procession Oak, between
Tonbridge and Bromley, three miles from the latter place, by men who
eased him of his rings and money, tied him to a tree and left him.
One of them was captured and " press'd to death." Hanging
Wood near Woolwich was the scene of man}* robberies in the
eighteenth century; the Bull Inn at the top of Shootei's Hill was
a favourite rendezvous of footpads, and tradition says that Dick
Turpin used to frequent it and that it was here he put the
landlady on the fire to make her confess where she hid her gold. It
was just be3*ond the Bull too, as we are told in the Tale of Tico
Cities, that the passengers of the Dover Mail, Mr. Jarvis Lorry,
of Telson's Bank among them, were terrified by the sudden
appearance of Mr. Jerry Cruncher, who however had come to
deliver a message, not to have purses delivered to him.

Here too it was that Don Juan was soliloquising over the
distant view of London when he was interrupted by a knife, with,  
  
  
  
\"Damn your eyes !
Your money or your life."


The records of Gadd's Hill alone would occupy a full chapter,
and the curious in such matters cannot do better than consult
Cruden's History of Gravesend. Mr. Ebsworth in his admirable
notes to the ballads in the "Kentish Garland" reprints from
Mochett's Journal the story of a Kentish ride to York, which we
must quote :


"In the year 1676 a gentleman was robbed about 4 o'clock in
the morning by a man Nicks, who, to prevent detection (as he
afterwards confessed) proceeded to Gravesend, where he was
detained nearly three hours for want of a boat to convey him across
to Essex for Chelmsford; he then proceeded to Braintree, Bockey and
Wethersford (now known as Booking and Weathersfield), over the
downs to Cambridge, keeping the cross-roads to Godmanchester and
Huntingdon, by Fenny Stratford, where he baited his horse and
slept about half-an-hour. He then rode full speed to York (176
miles N by W of London), where he arrived in the afternoon.

\"Here lie changed his dress, and mixed with the company in the
bowling green and soon selected out the Mayor of that city, of
whom he enquired the hour of the day, who pulled out his watch
and told him it wanted a quarter to eight. Some time after Mr.
Nicks was prosecuted for the robbery, and the whole merit of the
case turned on this single point. The person who had been robbed
swore to the man, but Nicks produced the Mayor of York, who
proved his being at the bowling green ou the day in question.
The jury therefore acquitted him, on the supposition that it was
impossible for him to be the man and also to be in York on the
same day."
<!-- Leaf 377, Page: 313 -->

As for the other Kentish road robbers, this is what Smollett
wrote in 1763 about the Dover road and Dover :—" I need not tell
you that this is the worst road in England with respect to the
conveniences of travelling, and must certainly impress foreigners with
an unfavourable opinion of the nation in general. The chambers
are in general cold and comfortless, the beds paltry, the cookery
execrable, the wine poison, the attendance bad, the publicans
insolent, and the bills extortion; there is not a drop of tolerable
malt liquor to be had from London to Dover.

"Every landlord and every waiter harangued upon the knaveryof
a publican in Canterbury who had charged the French ambassador
forty pounds for a supper wllich was not worth forty shillings.
but when the}* produced their own bills they
appeared to be all of the same family and complexion.

"Dover is commonly termed a den of thieves, and lam afraid that
it is not altogether without reason that it has acquired this
appellation. The people are said to live by piracy in time of war, and ley
smuggling and fleecing strangers in time of peace. Without all
doubt a man cannot be worse lodged or worse treated in any part
of Europe; nor will he in any other place meet with more flagrant
instances of fraud, imposition and brutality. One would imagine
they had formed a general conspiracy against all those who either
go to or return from the Continent."

Byron's lines in Don Juan about the iniquities of Dover, although
well known, are worth quoting :—  
  
  
  "Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,

Thy cliffs, dear Dover ! harbour and hotel;
Thy custom house, with all its delicate duties,

Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;
Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties

To those who upon land or water dwell;
And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,

Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted ! "


Until 1792 the curfew bell was rung at Dartford, quite as much
for the benefit of travellers over the wild, open countiy, who,
without its guiding sound could easily have strayed to their deaths on
bitter nights amongst the lone unfrequented tracks which led from
the high road, as in continuance of an ancient custom.

Smollett also describes how he was robbed and insulted by
the master of the vessel which was to take him to France, and later
we are presented with a picture of the Cross Channel packet of the
period.

\"We found ourselves in a most wretched hovel, on board what is
called a Folkestone cutter. The cabin was so small that a dog
could hardly turn in it, and the beds put one in mind of the holes
described in some catacombs, in which the bodies of the dead were
deposited, being thrust in with the feet foremost. There was no
getting into them but endways, and indeed they seemed so dirty
that nothing but extreme necessity could have obliged one to use
them. We sat up all night in a most uncomfortable position, tossed
about by the sea, cramped, weary, and languishing for want of
sleep."

This lasted from six one evening till three the next morning, and
then, instead of stepping on shore at once, the passengers had to
row three miles in a small open boat. The fare was five guineas,
<!-- Leaf 378, Page: 314 -->
besides "tips" to everybody who performed the slightest service,
from the captain downwards.

As a set off, however, it must be said that the travellers were
even worse treated and more robbed on the French side than in
Kent.


This was in time of peace. In time of war there was additional
excitement in the shape of a good risk of being captured or robbed,
or both; witness the following paragraph from a newspaper quoted
by Mr. Clark Russell:—

"Two gentlemen, passengers from Holland, landed at Margate.
They affirm they were in the evening boarded in sight of the North
Foreland by a privateer cutter, whose crew in disguise confined the
captain and crew of their vessel in the cabin, and then plundered
it of goods to the value of £2,000, demanded the captain's money,
and took what we had."


To avoid the land sharks of Kent the traveller at the beginning
of this century was offered the Margate Hoy. In this dainty craft,
sa3*s Mr. Clark Russell, he would be " one of a parcel of human
herrings squeezed into temporary shapelessness in an interior as
delicate for its aromas, as cheerful for its illumination as the rat
haunted forepeak of a wooden sailing ship. Why, you will read of
one of those ho3*s sometimes occup}*ing a week in " turning" down
the river and arriving at Margate. There was alwa3*s the chance
of their being blown into the Downs to strain for several days at
their cable in a seaway tco ugly to suffer the passengers to land 1"

Charles Lamb, on the other hand, laments the old hoy,
"illexchanged for the foppery and fresh-water niceness of the modern
packet ! "

The experiences of Fielding, the novelist, in 1753, when the ship
in which he sailed from London to Lisbon la3* off Deal, are of much
the same character as Smollett's, what with the Deal dentist who
pulled poor Mrs. Fielding all over the room and then gave up the
job; the exorbitant charges of the Deal people for provisions and
boat hire, and the miseries of an ill-found ship and a brutal
captain.

In short, it was no wonder that 011I3" the very rich and those who
were compelled b3* business travelled at all, and that no sane man
dreamed of starting on a journey of more than fifty miles without
seeing that his "house was in order."  
  
  
  D.-OLD KENT CRICKET.


To compile a History of Kent without an3* allusion to our Grand
Old (lame were to be guilt3* of an almost unpardonable sin of
omission, for assuredly if Hampshire may claim to be the cradle of
cricket Kent may fairly be called its nursery.

As briefly as may be I will deal with a large stock of material.
I am indebted to Mr. Philip Norman's admirable book upon the
West Kent Club for all allusions here to that Club, and to him
personally for much information about Kent cricket generally; to
various correspondents for communications in reply to an appeal for
information which I made in the Kentish Express; to the standard
works of Nyren, Pyeroft, Felix, Box, Grace, Bead and Ranjitsinhji;
and to the "Gentleman'sMagazine," the "Sporting Magazine," and

the Kentish newspapers of the 18th and early 19th centuries for
the rest.


The first allusion to Kentish Cricket is probably in the " Life of
the Rev. Thomas Wilson," published in 1672 by George Swinriocke,
who sa3*s:—" Maidstoue was formerly a very prophane town,
insomuch that (before 1640) I have seen mortice dancing, cudgel
pla3'iug, stool ball, crickets, and many other sports openly and
publicly on Lord's Day."

With reference to Sunday cricket playing I have more than once
heard of a Kentish village, I am not sure, but I think it was
Frittenden or Benenden, where the custom ahvays obtained that
the Parson should open the Cricket Season on Easter Sunday by
bawling the first ball on the village green directly after morning
service. I have also heard that he performed the ceremony iu his
surplice !  
  
  
  1705.—In the Postman of July 24th appears :
\"This is to give notice that a match will be plaid
between 11 gentlemen of the West part of Kent and
those of Chatham for eleven guineas a man, the game
to take place at Maulden (Mailing?) in Kent."
1711.—Charles Box speaks of a match between Kent and All
England, won by Kent, which resulted in an action of
law about a bet of £25. The Court remarked, "Cricket  
  
  
  is to be sure a manly game; it is the ill use that is
made of it by betting above £10 on it that is bad, and
against the laws which ought to be construed largely,
so as to prevent the mischief of excessive gambling."
1719.—We learn from Milt's Journal of May 26th that the Men
of Kent played the Men of London in Lamb's Conduit
Fields for £60 a side.
1729.—From the London Evening Post: " On Thursday was pla3*'d
a great cricket match on Kennington Common between
the Londoners and the Dartford men fora considerable  
  
  
  sum of money, Wagers and Betts, and the latter beat
the former much."  
  
  
  1731.—From the Grub Street Journal, May 27th :
"On Monday, 31st, will be pla3*ed on Kennington
Common a great cricket match between London and
Sevenoaks in Kent, and at the same place the next
day following will be another match between London
and Chelsfield in Kent."  
  
  
  1734.—In the London Evening Post, July 2-4 :
"On Monday next there will be a great cricket
match played on Kennington Common, in the County
of Surrey, between the Gentlemen of Sevenoaks and
the Gentlemen of London. The ground will be roped
round and all persons are desired to keep without side
of the same; the match is for a guinea a man, and the
wickets are to be pitched by 1 o'clock."
From the same :  
  
  
  
\"Last week was played at Sevenoaks in Kent a
great cricket match between the Earl of Middlesex,
the Lord John Sackville, and nine other gentlemen of
Kent, and Sir William Gage and ten other gentlemen
<!-- Leaf 384, Page: 316 -->
  
  of Sussex, when the Kent gentlemen beat. But thc
week before when they play'd on the Downs near
Lewes the Sussex gentlemen beat considerably, so
that's thought the conqueror will be pla3*'d in a few
days."
1735.—From the Grub Street Journal:
\"Y'esterday at the cricket match at Bromley
Common between the Prince of Wales and the Earl of  
  
  
  Middlesex for £1,000, the Londoners got 72 the first
hands, the Kent 95. The London side went in again
and only got 9 above the Kent men, wllich were got
the second innings without one person being out."
1736.—"Yesterday the great cricket match was play'd on
Kennington Common between the Gentlemen of Kent
and Surrey : the Gamesters were admirably good, and
to a man performed their parts. The Kentish men
went in first and got 41 notches; the Surre3* men 71.
At the Second Hands the Kentish men got 53, and the
Surrey men had but 23 to get, wliich the3* acquir'd with
ease, and had two wickets to spare. A great deal of
money was won and lost upon the occasion; but the
Game was so skilfully and justly play'd on each Side
that the ver3* Losers went awa3* satisfy'd. During the
game three Soldiers apprehended a Kentish man
sotDesertion; but the populace hearing of the matter,
join'd and rescu'd the Deserter out of their Hands, and
after a severe Discipline let them go about their
business.  
  
  
  
\"On Monday Se'night the Surrey men in their turn
are to wait upon the Kentish men at Cock's Heath
near Maidstone."


1737.—" Yesterday was pla3*ed on Bromky Common the second
great cricket match between the Kentish men and
those of London and Surrey, when the former
maintained their honour, and beat their adversaries at
one hand. The press was so great that a woman's leg
was broken by the crowd."

In the "Gentleman's Magazine" for September, 1743, appears a
very strong letter quoted from the British Champion condemning
the universal popularity of cricket. I have not room for thc
whole letter, but the following extracts give a notion of what
evidently was a ver3T prevalent opinion of the da3*.

After saying that in Diversions as well as business *,\ hat in one
man may be decent, ma3* in another be ridiculous, tlie author goes
on : " I have been led into these Reflections b3* some odd Stories I
have heard of cricket matches, which, I own, however, to be so
strange and so incredible, that if I had not received them from
E3*eWitnesses I could never have yielded to them any Belief. Is it not
a very wild thing to be as serious in making such a Match as in the
most ordinary Occurrences in Life'! Would it not be extremely odd
to see Lords and Gentlemen, Clergymen and Lawyers, associating
themselves with Butchers and C'oblers in Pursuit of these
Diversions ? Cricket is certainty a very innocent
and wholesome Exercise, 3*et it may be abused if either great or
little People make it their business. It is grossty abused when it is
<!-- Leaf 385, Page: 317 -->
made the Subject of publick Advertisements to draw together great
Crowds of People, who ought all of them to be somewhere else.
Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Clergymen, have certainty a right to
divert themselves iu what manner the3' think fit.; nor do I dispute
their Privilege of making Butchers, Coblers or Tinkers their
companions, provided these are qualified to keep them company. But
I very much doubt whether they have any Right to invite
Thousands of People to be Spectators of their Agility at the
Expense, of their Duty and Honest3' Tlie Diversion of

Cricket may be proper in Holiday Time, and in the Country; but
upon Da3*s when Men ought to be bus3', and in the Neighbourhood
of a great City, it is not only improper but mischievous in a high
Degree. It draws Numbers of people from their Employment, to
the Ruin of their Families. It brings together Crowds of
Apprentices and Servants whose Time is not their own. It propagates a
Spirit of Idleness at a Juncture when, with the utmost Industry,
our Debts, Taxes, and Decay of Trade will scarce allow us to get
Bread." And so forth. Upon which the only comment is the trite
one about tempora mutantur, etc.

In 1746 Kent played All England on tlie Artillery Ground at
Finsbury, and won b3* one wicket. At this match the Prince of
Wales, the Duke of Cumberland, and Admiral Vernon were among
the visitors. This is the first cricket match of which thescoresheet has been preserved, and it is the subject of a poem by James
Dance, alias Love, alias Scriblerus Maximus, the Comedian, in 1770,

beginning :  
  
  
  " Hail Cricket ! Glorious, manly British game !
First of all sports, the first alike in fame I "  
  
  
  And afterwards :  
  
  
  " And see where busy counties strive for fame,
Each greatl}' potent at this mighty game :
Fierce Kent, ambitious of the first applause,
Against the world combin'd asserts her cause."  
  
  
  The Kent eleven on this occasion was :  
  
  
  Lord Sackville; Hodswell, the tanner of Dartford, bowler;
Ruiusey; Mills, of Bromley, bowler; "Long" Robin;
Mills; Sawyer; Cutbush; Bartrum; Kips, wicket keeper;
and Danes.


In 1751 : " A match will be play'd between the Gentlemen of
the neighbourhood of I!romle3' and Dartford for 100 guineas."

In 1769 the famous old Vine ground at Sevenoaks was given by
the Duke of Dorset to be a cricket ground for ever, although no
deed of gift is discoverable. Sir Horace Mann was a great patron
of Kent cricket; he served as M.P. for Sandwich during five
Parliaments—thirty-three years.

In 1771 was played at Leeds Park the Gentlemen of Bethersden
against the Gentlemen of Leeds for half a guinea a man.

In 1772 Kent beat Hampshire (Hambledon) at Bishopsbourne by
two wickets. This was the subject of a contemporary pecan.

In 1773 Surrey beat Kent at Bishopsbourne b3* 153 runs. The
stake on this match was no less than £2,000, and the game was
made the subject of a parody on Chevy Chace by John Buncombe,
<!-- Leaf 386, Page: 318 -->
entitled "Surrey Triumphant, or the Kentish Men's defeat." It
begins :  
  
  
  " God prosper long our harvest work,

Our ricks and hay carts all,
An ill tim'd cricket match there did  
  
  
  At Bishopsbourne befall."
Another verse runs :  
  
  
  " From Marsh and Weald their hay-forks left,

To Bourn the rustics hied;  
  
  
  From Romney, Cranbrook, Tenterden,

And Darent's verdant side."


For Kent were playing : Sir Horace Mann, Hussey (Ashford),
Davis, Tom and Dick Ma3', Simmons, Miller, Wood (Seal), Lewis,
ete.


In the " returned match " Kent had her revenge and won by six
wickets.  
  
  
  1774.—Kent v. Hambledon at the Vine, Kent won in 1 innings
and 35.  
  
  
  Kent v. Hambledon, at Hambledon, Kent won ly

4 wickets.  
  
  
  1775.—Kent v. Hants at the A*ine (Kent with 2 bowlers), Kent
won.  
  
  
  1776.—Kent v. Surrey at Kennington, Surrey won in 1 innings
and 65.  
  
  
  1779.—Mr. W. W. Read publishes in his "Cricket" an old
engraving of a match played at Sevenoaks by the
Countess of Derby and other Ladies of quality.
Verily there is nothing new under the sun !
17S0.—Duke of Doiset's 11 v. Sir Horace Mann's 11 at the A'ine

for 300 guineas. The latter won.

About this period there was Cricket played all over Kent, and
the newspapers are full of announcements and reports, so that one
Editor declines to publish any more on account of the space
Uptake up.

1786.—Kent v. Hambledon at the Vine, Kent won by 4 wickets.

17S7.—Kent v. Hambledon at Coxheath, Hambledon won b3*
2 runs.  
  
  
  1788.—Kent v. England at Coxheath, England won by 1 innings
and 80.  
  
  
  1789.—Kent v. England at Coxheath, England won by 1 innings
and 10.


1791.—Kent v. M.C.C. (with Beldham and Fennex—the original,
no doubt of "M.C.C. and Ground")—M.C.C. won bj*
1 innings and 113.

\"There was no mistaking the Kentish boys," savs Beldham,
\"when the3T came staring into the Green Man. A few of us had
grown used to London, but the Kent or Hampshire men had but to
speak and show themselves and 3*011 need not ask them whieh sides
they were on." This was the Green Man and Still in Oxford
Street, a favourite house of call for cricketers.
1792.—Gentlemen of Kent (with Beldham and Harris) v. All
England for 1,000 guineas. England won.
<!-- Leaf 387, Page: 319 -->
  
  
Gentleineu of Kent (with Beldham and Rumsey) v.
Gentlemen of Essex (with Fennex and Scott) for 500  
  
  
  guineas. Kent won.

Kent (with two men) v. Hants (with two men) for

1,000 guineas, on Dartford Heath. Hants won.
Kent. v. Essex at Hornchureh. Kent won by 158.
Kent (with Beldham) v. Essex at Dartford. Kent
won by 81.

(From the frequent expression "with two men," in the matches
of this period, it seems as if the bowling of Gentlemen was, as it
is now, their weak point.)

1796.—Kent v. Middlesex (with Wells) at Lords. Kent won by
51.


1798.—Surrey began to rise as a cricketing county.

Missing out a number of matches we come to an extraordinary
game pkeyed in 1807 between 13 of All England and 23 of Kent on
Penenden Heath for 1,000 guineas. Kent won by 162. It was
about now that Willes started a revolutionary movement with his
\"straight arm " bowling.

In 1812 the Prince's Plain Cricket Club was founded at the
Plough, Bromle3' Common—(once a typical old-world roadside inn
with a serving shelf in the window, now—well, suburbanised !)
This was the forerunner of the famous West Kent Cricket Club.


In 1S15, on the " Knapps " at Wrotham, England beat Kent by
51.


About now was written the "Lay of the Kentish Cricketer,"
being the doings of a 3'ouug Kentishman in London town :  
  
  
  " Now de fust thine; I heerd on which made my art glad,

Was a wonnerful girt match o' cricket;
For in Kent, ye must know, dare is many a lad

Dat is famous for bat, ball, and wicket."


He is asked to fill up a vacancy at a Lord's match, and he bowls :
\"Well, I did take the ball, and a teejus good bowl I made on it,
for I broke all dere heads, arms, legs, bats an' wickets, an' pretty
soon made the game ourn ! "

The same year (1815) East Kent played West Kent on Penenden
Heath.


In 1816 wides were first scored, entered as " b3Tes," not until 1S27
were they scored separately. Prince's Plain beat M.C.C. this year by
10 wickets. In 1822 Bromley Common was enclosed, so the Prince's
Plain Club removed to the well-known ground near the Tiger's Head
at Chislehurst.


The "proper" cricket costume of this time was a light shirt,
hat with flattened crown (men were continually getting out by
their hats falling on the wicket), thin white cord breeches, gauze
stockings almost transparent, and silk socks turned over the
ankles. The cricket lunch was at three o'clock; sherry was drunk
at lunch and port after, and the snuff box was alwa3*s placed ou
the table. At any rate this was the West Kent custom.

In 1822 the new ground at Chislehurst was inaugurated b3* Kent
beating M.C.C. 1)3' 149 runs.

At the Kent and England match at Lords this 3*ear, when Kent
won, Willes' "straight arm" bowling was protested against, and
in wrath he withdrew from the match.
<!-- Leaf 388, Page: 320 -->

Mynn and "Felix" both crippled themselves financially in their
zeal for the county game, but, b3* unanimous consent, they were
retained on the list of amateurs, although paid for playing.

In 1822, at Mailing, Sussex beat Kent by 32. It was at this
game that the first "card o' the match " was printed.

1823.—Kent v. M.C.C. Drawn in favour of Kent. In this
match Alfred Mynn bowling struck second longstop six times
running in tlie chest, and the man spat blood for a fortnight
afterwards.


1827.—Kent v. M.C.C. Kent won by 158.
Kent v. Sussex. Sussex won by 7 wickets.

At this time arose the controversy about "fair" bowling. The
Sporting Magazine, reporting the above match, remarks that
"throwing was the order of the da3T," in reference to the deadty,
and, according to modem notions, perfectly fair, round arm
bowling of Lillywhite and Broadbridge.

In this v'ear Sussex beat Kent at the Vine and at Brighton, no
doubt thanks to Lillywhite and Broadbridge. Sussex also played
three matches with All England for 1,000 guineas a side. After
the second match the England pla3*ers signed a protest that they
would not pla3' off the rubber unless Sussex bowled fairty.

Iu 1828 Mr. George Knight, of Godmersham Park, announced
his proposal of a new rule to the M.C.C. Speaking strongty in
favour of the new bowling on the plea that the batting was too
strong for the old underhand bowling, and that matches were
unduly prolonged—(nothing new, etc., again !)—he proposed that
the rule should be "if any part of the bowler's hand or arm be
above the shoulder at the time of deliver the umpire should call
' No Ball !'" He added that round-hand bowling had long been
prevalent in Kent.

The before alluded to AA'illes, a Kentish 3-eoman, is one of the
many men who are said to have had round-arm bowling suggested
to them by the efforts of a little girl to throw up a cricket ball.

This same 3'ear a howl went up about the inordinate waste of
time at matches. The howl has been going on ever since, 3'et more
time than ever is wasted. But at any rate these grand old players
knew nothing of the three rotting cankers of modern cricket—the
individual batting average, the practice net, and the boundary
system!

1832.—Kent v. M.C.C. at Chislehurst. Kent won by 3 wickets.

1833.—Gentlemen of Kent v. M.C.C. (with Pilch and Marsden).
Kent won b3* 8 wickets.

1834.—Kent v. England. England won by 9 wickets.
This 3'ear there was a great single wicket match in
wliich Pilch, Marsden, and Lill beat Mynn, Wenman,
and Mills.


About this time Fuller Pilch, a Norfolk tailor, was brought to
Town Mailing under the auspices of the cricket-loving gentry of
the county to develop Kentish cricket; the result was the
formation of the famous old Kent eleven.—The brothers Mynn;
Wenman, the wicket keeper; W. Hiltyer, a gamekeeper; Pilch;
Martingell; Munn; the two Dorringfons; Tom Adams; and
"Felix"—whose real name was Wanostrocht, a Surrey man by
birth as was Martingell, but kept a school at Blackheath for
many years.
<!-- Leaf 389, Page: 321 -->
1835.—Kent v. England at Chislehurst. Kent won in 1 innings
and 41 runs.  
  
  
  1837.—Kent beat Sussex at Mailing. Gentlemen wore tall white
hats which cost 35s. each. Redgate, the fast bowler,
wore shorts and white stockings.
1838.—Single wicket match at Mailing for £100 a side between
Mynn and Dearman of Yorkshire. M3'nn made 123,
Dearman 11.  
  
  
  
This 3*ear the last great match was played at
Chislehurst—M.C.C. v. Gentlemen of Kent with

Adams and Hillyer. Kent won by 7 wickets.

1839.—A splendid match at Mailing for Pilch's benefit. Kent beat
England by 2 runs. The Kent eleven were AA*. and A.
Mynn, Hiltyer, Steerman, Pilch, Wenman, Whittaker,
Mills, Dorrington, Clifford, and Adams.
In 1842 the Canterbur3* Week was started, and from now the
Cathedral City became the centre of County cricket. In a match
between the Gentlemen of Kent and the Gentlemen of England at
Lord's this 3*ear there weie no less than 159 extras !

In 1843 Kent beat England three times. In one of the matches
Mynn's bowling analysis came out thus : 24 overs and 2 balls, for
40 runs and 8 wickets.


The Kent and Sussex match of 1846 at Brighton is the subject of
the large engraving so often to be seen in the parlours of Kent
and Sussex inns.


In 1847 Kent won every match she pla3'ed, and in this 3'ear
Willsher, of Rolvenden, came out for the count3*.

From 1835 to 1853 there were thirty-five matches between Kent
and England. For the first sixteen 3*ears Kent more than held her
own.


From 1853 to 1859—Willsher and " Farmer " Bennett's period—
Kent went to the bad. In 1859 the County Club was formed, Mr.
{empty}W. S. Norton being the first secretar3*.

Sevenoaks was of old the chief cricket bat making place, and
Clout of the same town was a famous ball-maker. The great
grandfather of Duke, cricket ball maker of Penshurst, presented the
first treble-seamed ball to the Prince of Wales in 1780.


The chief old Kent cricket grounds were at Sevenoaks, Coxheath,
Bromle3* Common, Chislehurst, Dandelion Fields, Thanet; Cobham
Park, Dartford Brent, Benenden, Mailing, Greenwich, Woolwich,
Penenden Heath, and Bourne Park.

The following Advertisement appeared in " Bell's Life " and the
"Sporting Life" of 1S72 :
\"The Old Kent County CC.

"Three old pkiyers of the above Club and natives of the celebrated
parish of Benenden, Mr. T. G. Wenman (age 71), Mr. E. G.
Wenman (age 71), and Mr. R. Mills (age 77) take the liberty of giving a
public challenge to play a match of cricket with any three of
England of not less average age than 73. They will make the match
for aiy amount not exceeding £100."

The challenge was not taken up.

I would like to mention that the doyen of Kentish cricket, Mr.
Herbert Jenner Fust, is still alive and well although 92 years of
age. He played in the Eton Eleven at Lords so long ago as 1822,
and was President of the M.C.C. in 1833.
<!-- Leaf 390, Page: 322 -->

A verse or two from Prowse's famous poem In Memoriam Alfred
Mynn ma37 aptly conclude :—  
  
  
  " When the great old Kent Eleven, full of pluck and hope began
The grand battle with All England, single-handed, man to man,
How the hop men watched their hero, massive, muscular and tall,
As he mingled with the players, like a king amongst them all;
Till to some old Kent enthusiasts it would seem almost a sin
E'er to doubt their countj*'s triumph when led on by Alfred Mynn.  
  
  
  Though Sir Frederick and the Veteran bowled straight, and sure,

and well,
Though Box behind the wicket onty Lockyer can excel;
Though Jemmy Dean as longstop would seldom grant a bye,
Though no novices at batting were George Parr and Joseph Guj';
Said the fine old Kentish farmers, with a fine old Kentish grin,
'Why, there ain't a man among'em as can match our Alfred Mynn!'  
  
  
  And whatever was the issue of this frank and friendly fray,
Aye ! and often has his bowling turned the fortune of the day!
Still the Kentish men fought bravely, never losing hope or heart,
Every man of the Eleven glad and proud to play his part.
And with five such mighty cricketers 't'was but natural to win,
As Felix, Wenman, Hiltyer, Fuller Pilch and Alfred Mynn !  
  
  
  With his tall and stately presence, with his nobly moulded form,
His broad hand wa3 ever open, his brave heart was ever warm;
All were proud of him, all loved him; as the changing seasons pass
As our champion lies a sleeping underneath the Kentish grass,
Proudlv. sadly, we will name him—to forget him were a sin—
Lightly lie the turf upon thee kind and manly Alfred Mynn ! "
